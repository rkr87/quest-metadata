        "description": "The entire scenic horizon becomes sunrise and sunset during the High Desert Eclipse. From your remote majestic hilltop, see the rapidly encroaching shadow of the Moon turn day into twilight. \n\nThe heavens and earth had to move to capture and bring you this 360 documentary short film from its unique vantage point! \n\nExperience the 2017 great American total solar eclipse like no other, in 4k 360 video. Feature spans through 2 minutes each of pre-, full, and post-totality from its remote location in the Oregon desert. The “once-in-a-lifetime” experience that users at VR events and film festivals love. \n\nBrings back fond memories for anyone fortunate enough to have seen a full eclipse in their lifetime and a rare chance to see one for those unable to travel.",
