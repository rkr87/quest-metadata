        "description": "Explore the worlds within worlds that surround us every day, but usually go unnoticed by the human eye through gamified learning. \n\nAfter a lab test gone wrong giant ants, a protist and even fungi are taking over the city and  it’s on you to use science to your advantage and clean up the whole mess before anyone notices. On your adventure, you’re joined by STEVE, the lab’s AI assistant, and will be the first to try out his newest invention, Shrink-o-gen. Scanning and scaling your way through the environment over the course of 4 missions, you’ll learn about the different rules that apply to each realm - molecular, bacterial, insect, human, and mountain.\n\nIn addition to the base game, there’s also a Multiplayer Theater where you can watch your favorite 2D Kurzgesagt videos in a whole new way with friends. And in case that’s not enough - you can even bring objects and creatures you collected in-game to life in the comfort of your own home via the Mixed Reality Sandbox.",
