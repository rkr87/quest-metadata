Put on your Quest and enjoy a magical experience that is not only fun but will teach you how to play this beautiful instrument in real life.\n\nChoose from a library of classical pieces or upload your own favorite songs to play. Thanks to the intuitive 3D notation system you will be able to jump in right away - no prior experience or reading sheet music required. \n\nDon't have a piano at hand? No problem: use the Virtual Keyboard option to play on your desk, or on your lap, or really anywhere. Thanks to the Quest's advanced hand tracking the app detects what keys you are playing just by looking at your fingers. This makes piano learning with Magic Keys even more accessible and ubiquitous. \n\nNow is the best time to start your musical journey and realize your dream of playing the piano.",
