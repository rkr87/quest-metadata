        "description": "INVERSE is a multiplayer horror game where 1 player is the monster and 4 other players work together as Agents to complete their objective and defeat the Nul monster.\n\nThe Foundation wanted to advance teleportation technology. What they found was a pathway to a dangerous world beyond our own, and they opened the door to the creatures that inhabit it. Play together or die alone in INVERSE!\n\nTHE AGENTS\nWork together as Agents to restore power to the control terminals before time runs out. Communicate with each other using walkie-talkies, revive your downed teammates using defibrillators, and slow down the Nul with a trap mine. Once power is restored to all terminals, the weapons vaults are unlocked and it is time to go on the offensive and eradicate the Nul. Unlock additional perks and equipment loadout to customize your gameplay strategy.\n\nTHE NUL\nPlay as the Nul and power up your attacks to incapacitate the team of Agents to claim victory. Agents will try to slow you down any way they can. Avoid activated trap mines and destroy any locked doors in your path. Your supernatural abilities and perks will help in your hunt; unlock perks and unleash the horror! \n\nBUILD YOUR SKILLS\nPlay the single-player challenge maps to build your skills and unlock Foundation Logs to learn more about the world of INVERSE and the Nul monsters that are threatening our existence.",
