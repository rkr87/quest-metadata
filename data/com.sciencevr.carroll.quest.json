        "description": "This is a paid preview to fund our further development as we visualize human knowledge in VR. Thank you for your support! \n\nIn Carroll’s Riddles, you’ll play games based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865) and The Game of Logic (1886). Carroll's Riddles is a new expression of storytelling and STEAM-based learning in an imaginary place where ideas can be visually expressive and evocative. Alice’s travels down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass are found in classic and modern stories, as subject of many a metaphor and neologism. By combining Carroll's logic with stories and art from Wonderland, we’ve expanded the context and meaning of this legend. In 1886, Lewis Carroll invented the Carroll Diagram, a tool to allow a player to visualize attributes and classifications of subjects. Confronted by interactive Carroll Diagram challenges, you solve each puzzle and gain a deeper appreciation for the underlying principles that govern this world of wonder and delight.",
