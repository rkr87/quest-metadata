        "description": "GAMEPLAY\nWe developed this game with a pretty simple idea in mind: you throw colored cubes in colored boxes. That's it.\nIs that's so easy, you may ask, well, try it yourself and let us know ;) \n\nENVIRONMENTS\nCreated entirely in 3D computer graphic, qb will transport you in a desolate world ruled by machines.\n\nSTORE\nGot stuck in a level? Visit the integrated store where you can exchange your game points with power-ups. No in-app purchase or real-money requested.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nPlease note that qb is a pure puzzle game for those who like this genere. We designed levels to provide a consistently growing difficulty enriching the traditional puzzle experience using virtual reality technology. If you don't like puzzle challenges then this game may not be for you.\n\nFREE UPDATES\nWith the 2nd update we expanded the game up to 25 levels including two special boss levels with unique gameplay.\nSuggestions or requests? Write us, we're here to develop and expand the world of qb!",
