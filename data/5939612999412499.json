Airplanes, helicopters, cars, boats, and more are available and new crafts are added every day.\n\n● Crafts with fully immersive cockpits have virtual controls that you can reach out and grab with virtual hands.\n● Download and fly crafts from SimplePlanes.com for free. Even if it does not have a fully immersive cockpit, you can still fly from the chase,  orbit, and fly-by camera modes.\n● Engage enemy aircraft with air-to-air missiles, such as the Guardian which is a highly maneuverable short-range missile, or fire and forget with the long-range Interceptor missile.\n● Assault ground threats with an extensive arsenal of air-to-ground weapons and sink ships with torpedos.\n● Multiple islands and airports to explore.\n● Several racing courses and other challenges.\n\nNote: Just to be clear, you can't build aircraft in SPVR, but you can download and fly crafts from SimplePlanes.com.\n",
