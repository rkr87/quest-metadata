        "description": "The Job interview VR app provides an immersive experience of a job interview. The app can be used to train and prepare for a job interview.  The simulation is based on a scenario that contains 12 main questions and 14 additional comments or questions that appear optionally depending on the answers to the main questions. In the interview scenario, the user takes the role of the job candidate and goes through a typical job interview. The interviewer appears in a typical office room, captured in a 360-video format from the point of view of the user. The app does not provide much guidance and instruction on how to perform at a job interview. Instead, the user is immersed in this situation and must react to it by answering questions from the interviewer. It is possible to record the sound of the answers provided by the user, to make the experience of the situation more realistic and to allow self-assessment and reflection by enabling playback of the entire interview.",
