        "description": "The game consists of number of levels divided into several episodes, set in different environments. New environments are unlocked only after passing the previous ones. To pass a level, the player must collect a certain minimum amount of crystals in that level. The crystals collected during the game are loaded into the ship's hold, which increases its weight and therefore reduces its maneuverability. The crystals are unloaded every time the ship lands on a platform and added to the total number of crystals in that level. After passing a level, the crystals are converted into currency that can be used to upgrade the ship.\n\nEach level begins on one of the platforms. A certain number of platforms are located throughout the map where the player can drop ballast. The platforms are usually located near large crystal resources, allowing the player to return to the same platform multiple times and explore the surrounding area. However, resource-rich areas are often closely guarded by enemy ships.\n\nEmbark on an exciting mission of exploring alien planets and moons, collecting precious resources and fighting enemy forces. Advance your career and build an invincible spacecraft to hover over fascinating alien worlds.\n",
