I corrected the code to support any frequency\n* Displayed in real time the frequency in the option menu (before it was a fixed 72 Hz value)\n* Standardized access to the OPTION menu (accessible with the 'menu' button on the left joystick instead of A or X buttons)\n* Removed the RULES button (how to play can be shared through this page)\n* A few improvements here and there\n\nNeoPunk"
