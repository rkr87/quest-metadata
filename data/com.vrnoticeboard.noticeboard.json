        "description": "Notice Board helps you catalogue your ideas and facilitates your note taking.  It is optionally used with the free mobile-compatible website (VRNoticeBoard.com) to allow you to create notes anywhere and organise them later in VR.  This process allows you to separate your note taking from the organisation of your thoughts, helping you focus on the task at hand while leaving the structure until later.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Organise your notes into virtual rooms with unlimited board space, and access them quickly using a visual interface. \n2. Your notes are projected onto a big VR screen, and you can manipulate them as if they were on real-life notice boards. \n3. Load/save your notes to file.\n4. Supports more than 30 languages.",
