In 1983, after decades of steady deterioration, John Hull became totally blind. To help him make sense of the upheaval in his life, he began documenting his experiences on audio cassette. These original diary recordings form the basis of this project, an interactive non fiction using new forms of storytelling to explore his cognitive and emotional experience of blindness. \n\nNot recommended on Galaxy Note 4.\n\n Produced by Ex Nihilo, Arte France in co-production with Archer’s Mark. Executive Producer, Audiogaming. Supported by TFI New Media Fund and Ford Foundation – JustFilms, CNC and Région Midi-Pyrénées.\n",
