        "description": "The Break-In is a 4 player online co-op burglary game about sneaking into houses, stores, and casino vaults to steal everything that isn't bolted down. (And maybe some of the things which are bolted down)\n\nIf you can get it into your van, you can sell it for a profit. And you can use the money you make to purchase new thief equipment, to help you take on riskier heists\n\nUse a wide range of equipment to help you to extract the most valuable items from your target. Ladders and climbing picks can help you get in, then use attachable items like airbags and pistons to safely get your stolen items to your van\n⠀\nOther items like hammers, firecrackers, and wearable head lampshades can help you deal with any residents, either by knocking them out, distracting them, or hiding from them.\n\nThe climbing freedom gives you full freedom to get around. Clamber up drainpipes, crawl through windows, or even stealthily make your way to the roof to scout the area\n\nJust be careful to make sure that nobody is waiting for you on the other side of the window, it's a long way down and you didn't bring a trampoline. Or maybe you did, and this is all part of your plan?\n\nEvery mission you enter has randomised room varieties including different points of entry, so you'll have to make a new plan for each place you infiltrate\n\nNPCs are also randomised, so make sure you scout the area well before going in. You never know what might be guarding that jewelry, an angry resident, a trained guard, or a camera?",
