Although, the game is still perfectly playable without the added height.\n- Moved the controls screen to a sign, located at the start of the game next to the new map sign.\n- Replaced title music with a low rumble.\n- Replaced the game's background sound with a low rumble.\n- Replaced the player's footstep sound.\n- Replaced the item's sounds to a click.\n- Replaced the static when the player is close to CAT with a louder static.\n- Added a static sound to the lose screen.\n- Added a cheer sound to the win screen.\n- Added a flashlight toggle. This doesn't have any purpose yet.\n- The item's outline distance has been increased, you might see them this time.\n- Renamed \"Item's Collected\" to \"Item's Found\" to be simpler.\n- Added a fade between screens to increase comfort.\n- Fixed height of the phone booth, now it should be able to fit an adult human inside.\n- Added a cool visual effect when the player dies wins, I think you're gonna like this one ;)\n- Removed the leaves from all the trees, this increased the performance by a lot.\n- Limited the refresh rate of the Quest to 60hz and the Quest 2 to 75hz as this is the highest stable frame rate they can currently reach. I will continue to find fixes for performance."
