Watch the VR potato draw on your device or on a stream, input custom prompts, make your guesses, and use special powers to foil your fellow future french fries!\n\nAs the VR potato, choose your medium — 3D shapes, air-painting, or canvas drawing — to dazzle your fellow spuds with your artistic prowess.\n\nDraw your worst, guess your best — just don't eat the artist. Please.",
