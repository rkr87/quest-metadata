        "description": "Fireproof Games continue their award winning game series, The Room, with The Room VR: A Dark Matter.\n \nThe British Institute of Archaeology, London, 1908: The disappearance of an esteemed Egyptologist prompts a Police investigation into the unknown. Explore cryptic locations, examine fantastic gadgets and enter an otherworldly space which blurs the line between reality and illusion. Designed from the ground up for the unique capabilities of virtual reality, players can inhabit the spine-tingling world of The Room and interact with its strange contraptions in this compelling new chapter.\n \nFireproof Games are a small independent team working in Guildford in the UK. We self-published our first game, The Room, in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room games have since changed our lives and we hope you enjoy our Virtual Reality take on the series.",
