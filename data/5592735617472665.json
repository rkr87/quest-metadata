        "description": "Immerse yourself in this atmospheric, open-world Viking adventure. \n\nWith an entire island to explore, a full cast of characters to interact with, challenges to solve, and wild animals to protect yourself from, this game will provide many hours of gameplay.\n \nYour home is surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered by a rival Viking lord's fleet of longboats. Your only hope is to restore an ancient magical protection which legend says was once gifted to your ancestors by the god Odin.\n\nYour goal is to restore that magical protection. It's a mission which will take you up mountain peaks and into deep underground caverns. You will ride in boats, search villages and houses, and break into mysterious caves. As well as interacting with the characters in the game, you will need to buy and upgrade weapons to fight off wild animals, unlock doors, solve puzzles and find your way past obstacles.\n\nBecause the game is open world, you can take it at your own pace - meaning you can focus on exploring Viking houses, or fighting wolves, or just relax and take in the sound of the sea! The only thing you need to ask yourself before buying this game is... are you Viking enough?",
