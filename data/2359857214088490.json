                "change_log": "----\nv61:\n----\n\nCalibration area:\n* When recentering in the calibration area, the instructions will now perfectly re-center in front of the user as additional feedback that it was effective.\n\nSettings area:\n* Removed debug feature that could unlock the whole tour.\n\nTour:\n* Fixed the inconsistent Tour Guide voice at the 2nd Mars tour stop\n* Fixed a grammar issue in the text where Rigel is shown at the center of the Solar System.\n* Applied question marks to the back sides of the Solar System bodies that have no available image data there.\n* Removed debug feature where users could fast-forward to the next tour stop by clicking the right thumbstick.\n* Fixed minor issues in subtitles.\n* Updated the orange Tour Guide button to display both play and pause icons to avoid confusion as to which state it is in. The user must now rely only on the brightness of the icon to know whether it is on or off.\n* Fixed an issue where planet orbit labels could be seen for a split second when starting transit to a point high above the Solar System.\n\n\n----\nv60:\n----\n\nGeneral:\n* Fixed an issue where selecting a different language would be unresponsive after visiting the tour and then returning back to the Tour Map and then the Settings area.\n\nCalibration area:\n* The calibration area now displays checkmarks when the user re-centers.\n\nTour:\n* Fixed an issue where the Tour Guide character's interactions sometimes did not properly align with planets in Sensitive-to-Motion mode.\n* Fixed an issue where the Sun label was not facing the user after arriving at the 2nd Pollux tour stop.\n* The user is no longer allowed to rotate Triton because the back side of Triton lacks map imagery.\n* The Tour Guide dashboard button's contrast has been increased, making it easier to discern details.\n* Fixed an issue where the titles of real photos could go missing if switching from a non-English language to English during the tour.\n\nTour Map area:\n* Fixed an issue where pointing at the Tour Map when it first loads up could cause one of the locked map nodes to display incorrectly.\n  \nCredits area:\n* Cleaned up developer credits in the Detailed Credits area.\n\n\n----\nv59:\n----\n\nGeneral:\n* Controllers have been updated to look like Quest controllers\n* Gloves now more closely align with real hands, mainly because they are now grasping Quest controllers\n* The Trigger buttons are now used for selecting buttons, and are no longer used for holding miniature planets in the user's hands.  The grip buttons are now used for viewing planets close up.  Note that the user now has a choice between using Button 1 (A/X) and the Trigger for button interaction, so they can use whichever control feels natural for virtual button interaction.\n* Controller labels have been turned into icons instead of text.\n\nLoading screen:\n* Fixed an issue where the initial fade-in would slightly glitch at the end of the fade-in, causing a visible difference in brightness of the loading graphic. The fade-in is now totally smooth.\n\nTour Map area:\n* Fixed not being able to view hands close when held close to the face.\n* Destination preview images have been updated to match the appearance of the updated stars (Sun and the 3 large stars).\n\nTour mode:\n* Users can now view a miniature closeup of the Moon along with the Earth.\n* Minor changes to some Tour Guide subtitles, removing unnecessary words and correcting grammar, etc.\n* Fixed the issue where the Tour Guide model would sometimes disappear before he finishes speaking. I was able to reproduce this by clicking the Oculus button during a Tour Guide presentation, waiting a bit, and then resuming. After resuming, the Tour Guide's actions no longer matched what he was talking about and would disappear early.\n* While touching or interacting with a dashboard grab-bar, a \"grab\" icon will show up next to the grip button on the controller.\n\nSide-by-Side Comparison mode:\n* Fixed an issue where using the controller menu button to go back to the tour would also cause the tour help menu to pop up.\n* Buttons in this mode can now be interacted by physically pressing them.\n* The current tour stop's body/bodies are no longer selectable, and are darkened.\n* The selected body's button is now shrunk to indicate that it is the selected body.\n* When indirectly selecting a new body to compare (via next/previous/random body buttons), the page containing the newly selected body will now automatically be shown.\n\nEVA mode:\n* The button to toggle surface labels is now light green instead of yellow-orange. This is intended to help it stand out from the button it replaces, and to avoid having too many yellow-orange icons shown on the controllers.\n\n\n----\nv58:\n----\n\nGeneral:\n* Updated app icon\n* Permissions dialog now shows name of the title instead of the package name.\n\nSettings area:\n* Fixed an issue where if you first selected a language such as French in the calibration area, then made your way to the Settings area, the \"Point & Click\" and \"Point & Wait\" labels were showing the wrong text, in addition to the popup detail panels to the left and right being blank.\n* The French \"pointer-attendre\" text is now word-wrapped to fit better.  In addition, both of the \"Point & Click\" and \"Point & Wait\" labels are now slightly shrunk for all languages except for English & Chinese to make the text fit more nicely within the border.\n\nTour Map area:\n* The About & Quit buttons in the Tour Map area are no longer shown on both the left and right sides, and have been rearranged around the other buttons in the center.\n\nTour:\n* Improved visual appearance for the Sun and all the large stars\n* Improved visual appearance for the vortex at the end of the tour\n* Fixed VY Canis Majoris size label from clipping harshly against the star's edge when viewed from close flyby\n* Planets and moons are no longer rendered when they are very close to the player's eyes. This avoids the problem of planets needing to switch to different materials to render under the atmosphere, and it avoids the problem of looking inside of a gas giant which can be disorienting.\n\n\n----\nv55:\n----\n\nGeneral:\n* Removed unusual Android permissions:\n  a) \"Allow Wi-Fi Multicast reception\"\n  b) \"Change your audio settings\"\n  c) \"Send sticky broadcast\"\n  d) \"Pair with bluetooth devices\"\n* Improved the appearance of the upper dashboard grabbar.\n* Controller label fonts have been updated.\n* Controller labels now mostly fade out when not directly looking at them.  To avoid a distracting effect, they are not meant to completely fade out.  The purpose of this is to make it seem like the labels & their lines are more ghostly and not a bunch of spiky physical things sticking out of the controllers.\n\nTour:\n* When fast-forwarding to the next tour stop (when not \"sensitive to motion\"), the cockpit will swivel much more quickly into place as it arrives at the destination, instead of a slower and possibly uncomfortable swivel sensation in some cases.\n* Improved the arrangement of info panel text at the 3rd tour stop (at Earth).\n\nSide-by-Side Comparison Mode (SBS):\n* The purpose of the page buttons has been clarified by darkening and making them inactive when you can't turn the page in a given direction.\n* Io is no longer missing at the Europa & Io tour stop.\n* Pluto and Charon have been rotated to show their good side when compared against a body.\n* Compared bodies at the Pan tour stop are positioned differently for a better experience.\n* Fixed being able to enter SBS mode at Tethys/Dione and Rhea/Titan.\n* Bodies being compared at Jupiter's moons are now shown above and behind the moons, rather than way off to the right which can be easy to miss, and hard on the neck if the user is sitting a chair with limited movement.\n\nZero-Gravity EVA mode:\n* When entering EVA mode the first time, the popup message clarifies what is happening by being titled \"ZERO GRAVITY EVA MODE\", instead of only \"EVA MODE\".\n* EVA boost sound effect volume has been lowered slightly.\n\n\n----\nv54:\n----\n\nGeneral: \n* Red colors reduced by 6% across the board.\n* OVR Plugin 1.40.0\n* The build is now 64-bit.\n* English font updated.\n* Whenever something is not translated, not only will it fall back to English, but also to the font used for English.\n* Wherever the language selection UI is visible, unsupported languages are now hidden.\n* Streamlined flow through the first few screens.\n* All settings are now remembered between sessions.\n* Improved menu/UI appearance.\n* Added three Oculus platform achievements that are earned by:\n  -- Completing the Full Tour (\"Completionist\")\n  -- Listening to both of the Tour Guide presentations at Mars (\"Martian\")\n  -- Listening to all of the Tour Guide presentations (\"Studious\")\n \nLoading screen: \n* Splash screen updated to something simple.\n* Loading screen now uses an overlay graphic, and is much quicker & smoother.\n\nCalibration area:\n* Because Quest cannot programmatically re-center the player, the player is now prompted to do so in this area before continuing on.  The reason an explicit re-center is required is so that the experience can center on the player's position and direction within their play space.\n* Because this area now contains a bit of text, added language selection UI at the top.\n* To encourage the player to learn that interaction is done via the A button rather than the trigger, a button in front of the player must be clicked to continue.\n\nSettings area:\n* This area is shown after calibrating, for the first play session only. After that, this area is skipped and the user can access it via the Settings button in the Main Menu / Tour Map area.\n\nMain Menu / Tour Map area:\n* New \"About\" buttons provide access to the area with a description and health & safety warnings.  Previously, this area was always shown to the user after continuing from the Settings area.\n* New users will see a few tour stops already unlocked, and this is intentional so that they can get a feel for how the tour map works, and what to expect as they proceed through the tour.\n* Some nodes in the Tour Map have been enlarged to emphasize the difference between the full tour vs the short tour.\n* Updated some of the Tour Map destination preview images.\n\nAbout area:\n* The popup panel no longer begs for reviews or makes any reference to early access.\n* The title graphic has been updated.\n\nTour:\n* Planet labels no longer appear huge when approaching them.\n* Each hand may now hold a different moon at tour stops with more than one moon.\n* Improved cockpit appearance & lighting.\n* Improved dashboard appearance & lighting.\n* Added a second grab-bar to make it easier to pull the dashboard up.\n* Touching a grab-bar now produces haptics.\n* Help menu no longer references the Related Experiences area.\n* Help & Options menus are pushed away from the player a little bit.\n* Options menu no longer displays Guide Options panel unless it is first enabled in the Modding area.\n* Fade-to-white transition at end of tour has been darkened a bit more.\n* Earth is now visible throughout the tour, instead of sometimes being hidden away like other planets. This has a big effect on appreciation for the size of Earth vs the Sun behind it.\n* Saturn now has lightning effects on the back side.\n* Earth's Moon now orbits more slowly after continuing past Pluto to get a view of the Sun.\n* Music can now be easily toggled on and off via a new button on the dashboard.\n* Users going through the tour a second time will have the option to fast-forward to the next tour stop. For users that indicated they are \"sensitive to motion\", the fast forward button appears above the blue triangle button when pointing at it, and for users that indicated they are not sensitive to motion, the fast forward button appears just after they have started moving.\n* Lightened the backside of some planets and moons to avoid black smearing.\n* Sound effect played at beginning of tour no longer plays for those that are sensitive to motion, and for those that are not sensitive to motion, it now plays at half volume.\n* Improved memory management. Tour Guide data is dynamically loaded at each tour stop, per-frame allocations reduced by 95%, and garbage collection disabled during the times where it would be easily noticed in the form of stale frames (while traveling between stops, while in EVA mode, etc).\n* Updated text for the first few three stops at Earth.\n* Improved popup message proportions.\n* Fixed jittery Earth movement during the Solar System expansion segment.\n* Venus is now less yellow.\n* Jupiter's visuals have been updated to use a newer global map instead of the old Voyager map.\n* Jupiter can now be rotated.\n* Mars is no longer gray when seen from a distance. This helps when fixed foveated rendering kicks in as it won't be so obvious.\n* Pluto has a new map, with more accurate colors as we would see with human eyes.\n* Pluto's small moons can now be rotated using the Rotate Planets functionality.\n* Pluto's small moons can now be grabbed in EVA mode.\n* More officially-approved surface labels have been added to Pluto.\n* Pluto and Charon's labels have been reoriented for easier viewing.\n* When resuming the tour, user can no longer interact with invisible buttons or hear rollover sound effects when pointing at them.\n* Improved the appearance of Enceladus's ice geysers.\n* Seat no longer appears when getting close to the floor in Standing mode.\n\nTour Guide:\n* New button icon for toggling Tour Guide.\n* Added Tour Guide presentations for Saturn, Uranus, Neptune & Pluto (with subtitles), bringing the total Tour Guide content to 110 minutes.\n* Re-recorded Tour Guide presentations for the 3rd Earth stop & Jupiter.\n* Tour Guide's mouth is no longer jittery at some tour stops (specifically at Uranus).\n* Cleaned up beeping sound in some Tour Guide presentations (especially at Mars).\n* Distracting button feedback is now suppressed while sitting and listening to Tour Guide.\n\nSide by Side comparison mode:\n* Debris is no longer shown.\n* Can no longer see the Moon's shadow passing over the Earth when the Moon isn't there.\n* Fixed abrupt changes to night sky brightness when going in and out of this mode.\n* Users can now only compare bodies they have already seen before in the tour.\n* SBS mode can now be used at the Pluto tour stop.\n\nZero-Gravity EVA mode:\n* Can now grab onto the Sun in the instances where EVA is allowed after passing Pluto.\n* Can now grab onto Jupiter.\n* User can now fly further away at the Jupiter tour stop.\n* The dashboard info panel hides itself when you move far enough away that the text becomes difficult to read.\n\nCredits area:\n* Music credits updated and clarified.\n* Easier-on-the-eyes background.\n* Updated logo and title graphic.\n* Forced English font.\n\nEnd screen:\n* Reduced the number of available actions, and rearranged them.\n* Updated title logo graphic.\n* The popup panel no longer begs for reviews or makes any reference to early access.\n\nEditor Mode (Not part of the typical user experience):\n* Now asks for Microphone permission on the fly, instead of when the app first launches.\n* Speaker notes are now headlocked w/ smoothing.\n* The Sun is darkened to make it easier to read notes.\n* The \"dummy\" player head is brightened to make it easier to see."
