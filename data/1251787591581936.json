When you arrive you will assume the character Melissa of Delos, a priestess in the temple of Aphrodite.\n\nThe city is Agra, India in the year 1640. The construction of the Taj Mahal, is well under way. You will play the character of Kasim Kahn, an apprentice to Ismail, the head foreman overseeing the building of what will become one of the greatest buildings ever designed and constructed.\n\nTravel thirty miles south of the South American Incan capital city of Cusco, Peru. The year is 1532 and two Incan brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, have fought a civil war for control of the empire their father built. You are Anko, an administrator sent by the victor, Atahualpa, to assess the estate of the past emperor.\n\nExplore and learn in wonders of the world!",
