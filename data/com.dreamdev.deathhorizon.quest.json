        "description": "The Horizon scientific research laboratory is a deceptively quiet place. When you came round, there were hundreds of the living dead all around you. All because of that damn T12 virus.\n\nTo survive and save the world from the virus, use both hands and your head: never stop shooting, pick up rounds, climb up pipes and ladders, jump onto bars and grab hold of ropes, search cupboards and throw everything you find at the zombies.\n\nYou’re free to choose whatever weapons and tactics you want. Prove your agility, imagination and accuracy.\n\nThe denizens of the Horizon station will punish you for one thing: hesitation.\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n●  Realistic bloody graphics in the spirit of zombie apocalypse films\n●  Use two controllers actively: fire with both hands, fire as you hang on a rope, reload your shotgun with your second hand, grab onto pipes and explore hard-to-reach areas of the station",
