Try not to Die. \n\nWelcome (back) to the world of Interkosmos for an even wilder, weirder and more wondrous adventure. \n\nExperience the intense exhilaration of spaceflight. Explore the awe-inspiring interiors of a realistic space capsule.\n\nMaster the crucial systems that will keep you in orbit (and breathing). And while youâ€™re at it, try your best not to die.\n\nShould you complete your mission, you just might save the future â€“ and yourself. Should you fail? Letâ€™s not think about that.\n\nWith more challenges, more stunning visuals and more hours of replayability than ever, the year 2000 has never been so thrilling. ",

You can access the smashing pumpkins game through the mission selection menu, under the new â€˜Extraâ€™ option.\n\nThis patch also includes:\n- Small festive treat in the cabin\n- Two new secret Achievements for the Sandbox Mode\n- Fix for an issue where the Orbital Transfer maneuver would finish too soon\n\nWith best regards,\nInterkosmos 2000 DevTeam\n"

Itâ€™s something many of you have asked for, and we think youâ€™ll like it!\n\nSandbox Mode is being releasedâ€¦ Today!\n\nSandbox Mode is an additional play mode separate from Training and Mission. For the first time weâ€™ve added an Orbital Maneuver Planner that you can use to calculate and visualize transfers to any target! \n\nThe Sandbox Mode gives you complete freedom of movement. It contains no story or radio talking, and allows you to explore Earthâ€™s orbit at your own pace. Look at the beauty of space, play with your orbit, test orbital mechanics, go where very few have gone before - the sky is yours. \n\nWeâ€™ve also added two historical spacecrafts for you to discover - the first artificial satellite, Sputnik; and the newest NASA capsule for the Artemis mission, Orion.\n\nSandbox Mode comes with some additional features to make your spaceflight a leisure:\n- With some amazing new technology, you can speed up the flow of time! Hold down the X button to fast forward. \n- When starting the playthrough you can opt-out of the resources management part of the gameplay (in addition to the previous two difficulty levels).\n- The Sandbox playthrough can be saved [when exiting to the Main Menu] -  this save is separate from the Mission/Training save, but is made on the same user game profile.\n\nIn addition to the Sandbox Mode, this patch brings several upgrades to the main game:\n\nNew UI:\n- Main Computer has been given a system update, introducing new graphics to our spaceflight software\n- Menus have been given a slight visual overhaul and better resolution\n\nMiscellaneous:\n- Helmet in Menu should be easier to grab\n- Due to new controls, the item-pulling accessibility options work only on the right hand\n\nWe thank you for your continuous support and love for the game!\nWhile we are not revealing what we are working on next, we can say that another exciting update will be coming soon!\n\nWith best regards,\nInterkosmos 2000 DevTeam\n"

No space programme is without its issues at first launch! [we are looking at you, NASA] \n\nFor this update we have removed two of the most frequent bugs and made one quality-of-life change. We are aware of the range of other issues reported by you, and we are working hard at fixing them (with our dev-wrench)! The next update will add even more quality of life improvements and fix more of the remaining bugs, in addition to adding many more surprises! Stay tuned, pilots! \n\nChangelog:\n- Fixed a bug where the Orbital Transfer system would read the wrong transfer data, leading to blocked progress. (There may still be some issues if you're very far away from FakeStar before starting the Orbital Transfer.) \n- Fixed issue where Scanning sometimes wasnâ€™t properly acknowledged \n- Delays between repetition of radio commands are now increasing with every repetition of the command, to avoid audio overstimulation \n\nThank you for all your feedback! Let us know if these changes resolved your issues, and tell us what you want to see moving forward. \n\n\nWith Best Regards,\nInterkosmos 2000 DevTeam\n"
