        "description": "The VR Chemistry Lab was originally designed to be a research tool where studies of VR learning environments could be explored. Currently, it is still being used in research but has potential for student use as a hands-on science lab experience at home or at school. It also contains experiences where players can explore molecule creation in an immersive environment as well as play a game of catalyzing a chemical reaction. \n\nThis is still a work in progress and there are many possibilities with its potential for education. Any encouragement, advice, and support is much appreciated.
