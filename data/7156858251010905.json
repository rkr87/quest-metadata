        "description": "Boom lifts are heavy-duty vehicles that help workers reach heights up to 150 ft. safely and efficiently without the need for ladders or scaffolding. The lift's platform can accommodate multiple workers and carry heavy materials to great heights. Boom lifts are versatile machines that can be used both indoors and outdoors, even on uneven ground. They are essential for construction sites, factories, warehouses, and commercial buildings. \n\nBackground Primer & Activities: \nAn overview gives context, identifying lift types, parts, safety worries, tipping lines, fall protection needs, and walk-around inspection basics. Participants then sort-and-match to learn central controls and startup steps. Learning outcomes: remember, understand, apply.\n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn and practice safely operating a boom lift in a safe and realistic format. Before beginning their tasks, participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct a thorough walk-around inspection of the lift. They must then navigate through the warehouse, collecting task items and repairing them at heights ranging from 45 to 65 feet. \n\nBenefits & Key Features: \n•Manipulative Simulation: Hands-on practice in a risk-free environment. \n•Instant Feedback to guide participants.\n•Transferable skills can be directly applied to real-world scenarios. \nRealistic 3D tools, equipment, and environments.
