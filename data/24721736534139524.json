        "description": "Do you know where Faroe Islands are? We took an expedition there and filmed all the beauty it can offer. \nWith this app you can fast travel there, just by putting your headset on. \n\nYou can enjoy full 360 3D videos of the nicest locations on the island and listen to spatial sounds of the nature accompanied with narrative voice over description of each location in English and German. Other languages like Spanish and French will be coming soon in an update!\n\nFeel the heights of the cliffs, observe the Puffins, stand under the waterfalls.\n\nThe final app now have over 120 viewpoints from around 40 scenes, where you can travel.\nIn each scene (touristic hot spot) you have usually around 3-10 viewpoints, where you can immerse yourself into the beauty of Faroe Islands. \n\nBut be careful, sometimes the locations are on an edge of a cliff and if you look at them in the immersive 360 3D view, you might get a bit dizzy.\n\nEmbark on an exciting journey to Faroe Islands now!",
