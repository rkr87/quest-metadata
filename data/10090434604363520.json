        "description": "*Please note that this game has entered LTS and there will be no future bug fixes/updates. There are bugs in this game that will not be fixed so that I can focus more time on future projects. So this game is buggy and unpolished so go in with low expectations! Thanks!*\n\n\nYou’re a nighttime delivery boy on your first shift with a full stack of piping-hot pizzas to deliver on a limited power supply. Your mission: deliver those pizzas before they get cold. \n\nBut there’s a catch. \n\nAn ever-growing mass of deadly horrors is lurking in the shadows—and they’re after much more than a slice!\n\nFortunately, you’re equipped with the perfect tools to take on the nighttime terrors. Armed with a flashlight, mirror, sound emitter and taser, it’s up to you to fight your way through the chilling horde and make your deliveries with speed and accuracy. But keep an eye on your power supply, or you’ll have more than cold pizza to worry about… \n\nCan you survive 5 nights on the job?\n\nTurn the tide across 5 spine-chilling nights—each more deadly than the last\nDeliver your pizzas with speed and accuracy to earn high scores\nFight back against the horrors with 4 unique tools\nAdapt your strategy to exploit their weaknesses\n\nWARNING\nThis game contains jump scares…\n\n",
