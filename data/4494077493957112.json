Teleport is now more resilient to failure to further prevent this from happening.\n- Fixed the “mulligan bug” where you could move out of and back into your shot area while the disc was in flight to be able to re-open your bag and take a shot from the same place you just took a shot from\n- Fixed some cases where your shot area could visually appear in a tree when moving around the course manually\n- Fixed bug where sometimes the “Go To Shot” button would not appear (particularly if you were moving around outside your shot area while your shot was happening)\n- Fixed bug where sometimes the throw power difficulty you picked in settings was not “sticking” before entering a match\n- Since the previous update there are now some Par 5 holes in the game - because of this, we added the ability to get an Albatross (3 under Par). This is also now tracked on the stats page in the menus\n- Removed Random Objects (say goodbye to the great red arrow)\n- Fixed typo for multiplayer map names\n- Hilly Forest is now displayed as an “easy” course\n- Updated sun tint on brisky and hilly forest.\n- Fixed UV and scaling issues with tee pads\n- Updated map 5 signpost images on a few incorrectly displayed boundary lines.\n- Removed ‘labels’ from the power meter that is displayed while the disc is flying. Minor UI adjustments to the ‘perfect zone’\n- Fixed tree collider issues that could have caused players to spawn inside trees\n- Performance fix on Hilly Forest map"
