        "description": "Welcome to Cloudlands: VR Minigolf mobile edition!  Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a virtual reality minigolf experience like you've never experienced before. Cloudlands uses an intuitive control mapping between the virtual putter and your Samsung GearVR or Oculus Go controller to make swinging feel natural, just like swinging a real putter.  Expect real-life golf skills to translate into the virtual world (oh no!).  Don't worry though.  It's minigolf!  Everyone can have fun and play.\n\nCloudlands includes a fantastical 18 hole course with access to over 1000 user created holes by some of the world's leading VR minigolf designers.  Expect to be challenged by ball cannons, floating bridges, spinning obstacles, and multi-island holes.\n\nIf you're tired of playing alone, challenge up to 3 other friends in 4 player local multiplayer.\n\nIf you own the Oculus Home version of the game, expect to see all of your content synced between the two platforms.",
