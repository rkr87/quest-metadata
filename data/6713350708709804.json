        "description": "Scissor lifts are flexible vehicles that help workers reach heights up to 60 ft. safely and efficiently without the need for ladders or scaffolding. The lifts have a platform that can accommodate multiple workers, making them perfect for team tasks. Indoor construction sites, factories, warehouses, and commercial buildings, use these lifts to perform tasks at height, such as maintenance, renovations, and moving building materials.  \n\nBackground Primer & Activities: \nAn overview provides participants with context and helps identify different types of lifts, related parts, safety concerns, tipping lines, fall protection requirements, and the basics of a walk-around inspection. Then, participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to learn the central controls and steps required for starting up. Embedded learning outcomes based on Bloomâ€™s revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying. \n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn and practice safely operating a scissor lift in a safe and realistic format. Before beginning their tasks, participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct a thorough walk-around inspection of the lift. They must then navigate through the warehouse, collecting task items and repairing them at heights ranging from 25 to 45 feet. \n",
