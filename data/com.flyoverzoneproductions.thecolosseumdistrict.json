        "description": "Rome Reborn® takes you back in time to the Flavian Amphitheater (“Colosseum”) and nearby monuments. Teleport from site to site to visit the arches of Constantine and Titus, the Colosseum, the Meta Sudans, the Temple of Venus and Rome, the Ludus Magnus, and the iconic Colossus of the Sun. Like all of Rome Reborn’s apps, this one offers expert commentary as well as reconstructions of the monuments as they appeared in antiquity and panoramic photographs showing you how they look today. \n\nYou will learn about the leaders responsible for commissioning the monuments, go inside the Temple of Venus and Rome (Rome’s largest religious sanctuary) to see the stunning cult statues, and get up close to the reliefs on the arches of Constantine and Titus, whose colors have been lovingly restored. We also take you to places not readily accessible to visitors to Rome, including inside the Venus cella of the Temple of Venus and Rome and down to the underground chambers of the Colosseum.",
