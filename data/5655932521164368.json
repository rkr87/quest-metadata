We also refined the UI, VFX, SFX, improved the volumes of all of our recordings and added a new interactive tutorial for first timers, alongside other UX improvements (like, the fishing rod is to the side now. so much better).\n\nüìî **Storybook** has an all new LINEAR mode as well as new interactive stories! These feature a unique, relaxing tone (and even a little bit of romance!), so we'd love to know your thoughts. Bonus points for whoever can find the story where Zucc has a romance with Elon Musk :Elon: :Zuckini: \n\nüå† **Stargazing** has been improved with better ceiling animations, hyperspace effects when you visit/exit constellations and lots of other visual & UX improvements that improve the feel and handling of the whole thing! It also has an interactive tutorial too!\n\nü´Å **Breathe** has been improved with new breathe-guidance SFX and beautiful mixed-reality subtitles for all of our meditations. \n\nAlso easier Setup has also been added to the experience, which should make getting started in the beginning a lot easier for some people. We also fixed bugs. Lots of bugs. The app should be much more stable and polished overall if you are showing off Pillow to family and friends this holiday season üôÇ\n\nThis is just the first of many free updates and I'm really happy to be sharing this journey with you guys.
