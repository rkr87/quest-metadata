        "description": "Archaround VR has been created with interior architects and developers in mind, aiming to showcase various interior projects while providing the option for their preliminary customization through color selection, material choices, and furniture elements. It introduces a new standard in interior architecture visualization, allowing for project presentations to clients in both the early design stages and during the refinement of final details.\n\nWith project presentations in Archaround VR, you can save countless hours otherwise spent on visualization creation and present an infinite array of color configurations and furnishing options simultaneously. This tool offers a new way to interact with clients, enabling fully remote presentations and effortless creation of their ideal interior compositions. Your clients will experience a completely new cognitive understanding of space, feeling as if they are truly immersed within it, thereby altering their perception of the project and ensuring the highest level of satisfaction.\n\nExplore the demo scene to see the application's capabilities, and reach out to us so we can implement your project.",
