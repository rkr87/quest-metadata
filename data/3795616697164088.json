The invite will timeout after 60 seconds, so you will have to invite them again.\nI fixed the paddle collision with the sidewalls of the Table and now the paddle should slide along the table edge instead of sticking.\n\nI simplified some of the networking code and as a test tried something a bit radical which seems to improve things over a LAN but may not be as good over a wider area. It's really just a test."
