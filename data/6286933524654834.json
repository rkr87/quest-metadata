        "description": "Autism fascinates, confronts and inspires. Although this distinct neurological condition encompasses a range of characteristics, there are as many ways of being autistic as there are autistic people - hence the spectrum. Lou is a fictional character created from the testimonies of autistic people and inspired by the autistic children of the two directors. You will witness a few days in the life of this charming and vulnerable person, from his 5th birthday to his first day of high school. Lou is doing everything he can to adapt to the neurotypical world. During this metaphorical and playful virtual reality experience, you will\nfeel the world with Lou's sensitivity. Through his sensitivity and specific interests, you will experience fascination, sensory overload and meltdown. You'll have to use unique coping mechanisms, as some people on the Spectrum do. It's an inclusive production. Several autistic people participated in the project. This work promotes empathy and a better understanding of this distinct neurological reality. ",
