Step into the virtual operating room and take a front-row seat, witnessing the intricate details of each procedure unfold before your eyes.\n\nThe Immertec app goes beyond passive observation by offering up to 4 additional medical feeds that you can customize to suit your preferences.

This personalized viewing experience ensures that you make the most of every surgical observation, tailoring it to your learning needs.\n\nBut Immertec doesn't stop at observation alone. It enables real-time communication and collaboration, allowing you to connect with the surgeon inside the operating room and engage with your peers who are attending remotely. Seamlessly exchange insights, ask questions, and gain a deeper understanding of the procedures as you collaborate with experts and fellow healthcare professionals.\n\nElevate your training and awareness in an immersive environment that replicates the real-world operating room experience. Expand your knowledge, sharpen your skills, and stay at the forefront of medical advancements, all from the convenience of your Oculus device.
