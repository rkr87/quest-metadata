        "description": "As a subject of a virtual test you have been transferred into a world where you are a customer of a robbed bank. Left alone and locked you must gather all of your abilities to get out of that space which is full of secrets. You have no one to help you except your own wit. Can you unravel the mysteries, solve the intricate riddles, and successfully make your escape?\n\nOne of the genres for which VR is perfectly suitable is the Escape Room. Dive into this experience and enjoy the capabilities of your VR Headset in this indie game that should take you around 90 minutes to finish without counting the bonus content.\n\nUpon completing the main storyline, a new game mode is unlocked - Speedrun. Try your best and publish your results to compete with your friends or the community worldwide.\n\nTwo bonus rooms \"Office Trouble\" and \"Geek Heaven\" are already available. Designed for those seeking an extra challenge after completing the main game, the bonus rooms provide a perfect continuation with new and more demanding puzzles.",
