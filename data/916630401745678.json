        "description": "Save our solar system in this full 360° retro inspired arcade action game. Protect all planets from alien invaders by controlling drones that are networked into an autonomous defense system. As you progress more planets come under attack, so you'll have to be wise to outmanoeuvre these cunning extraterrestrials who look to extinguish all life and resources in this galaxy.\n\nUsing your gaze to navigate this network of machines, supplant the threat on each planet before it reaches critical mass. The drone controls are dead simple – don your headgear and the head position tracking takes over – they shoot where you look.\n\nWith each unlocked planet comes with it its own weapon design to defend it against the UFOs. The more attack waves you fend off the better the chances to upgrade each drone with more stronger firepower and more shield damage. This will become imperative as you travel further to the edges of this solar system.",
