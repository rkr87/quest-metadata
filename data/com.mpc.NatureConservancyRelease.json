        "description": "The numbers are shocking. Overexploitation of the world's fish stocks is growing at an alarming rate, killing vulnerable species like sharks and turtles and robbing the economies of small pacific island nations. But if we can see it, we can save it. The Nature Conservancy, a leading conservation organization, is partnering with the tech community to bring deep learning to the deep seas to transform a multi-billion-dollar tuna industry and ultimately create a world where nature and people thrive. By mounting cameras on fishing boats and advanced machine learning that can track what is getting caught, we can prevent overfishing and help threatened and endangered sea life recover without putting fishermen out of work. Step into an immersive virtual reality art experience as you journey through gallery spaces and engage with poetic sculptures that communicate information through your actions.",
