Find your own happier place—in Innerworld! Our built-for-wellness worlds give you unlimited access to a social VR mental health peer support community. \n\nAfter passing a short screening, you’ll be able to join peer-led groups that follow a groundbreaking form of group intervention called Cognitive Behavioral Immersion™. This peer-led group approach gives users unlimited access to potentially life-changing mental health help. These event-based group sessions focus on issues that are important to users. They aren’t led by therapists or doctors—in fact, anyone can train to become a coach and begin to make an impact in the lives of others. \n\nInnerworld utilizes the immersive nature of the VR ecosystem to help users defy distance & the physical constraints of the real world, transporting them to their own happier place. \n\nIt’s affordable. Accessible. And totally anonymous.",
