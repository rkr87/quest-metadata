        "description": "Nancy’s sushi creations are so irresistibly delicious that they've caught the eye of a quirky group of Martians. These otherworldly beings are head-over-heels for Nancy's culinary delights, and they’re determined to take her back to their home planet to enjoy her dishes—permanently! The fate of Nancy’s restaurant—and indeed Nancy herself—rests in your hands.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nAs Nancy’s last line of defense, you’ll need to step into her shoes and use all your wits and reflexes to keep these Martians at bay. Armed with only her tiny fists and an unyielding spirit, Nancy will face wave after wave of these bizarre invaders. But don’t be fooled by their comical appearance; these Martians are relentless and will stop at nothing to get what they want!\n\n- **Dynamic Combat:** Experience a unique rhythm-based combat system where every beat counts. Your timing and precision are key to thwarting the Martian invasion.\n\n- **Epic Showdown:** The stakes are high. If Nancy manages to fend off the Martians, she’ll earn the right to add Martian sushi to her restaurant's menu—a feat that promises to put her eatery on the intergalactic map. But beware—if you fail, Nancy’s fate will be sealed, and she’ll become the Martians’ next sushi roll.",
