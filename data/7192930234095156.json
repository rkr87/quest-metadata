        "description": "Step into the eerie world of an abandoned asylum overrun by zombies in this intense VR experience. Armed only with a pistol and revolver, you must survive endless waves of undead attackers. Will you outlast the horde or succumb to the darkness?\"\n\nLong Description:\n\"Prepare to immerse yourself in the heart-pounding chaos of a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies within the confines of a decrepit, long-forgotten asylum. In this spine-chilling VR application, players are thrust into the role of a lone survivor armed with nothing but a pistol and revolver, navigating through the eerie corridors and dimly lit rooms infested with the undead.\n\nWith the press of the 'Start Game' button, the relentless onslaught begins as waves of zombies lurch towards you, driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh. Your survival instincts and marksmanship skills will be put to the ultimate test as you aim to dispatch every approaching threat before they overwhelm you.\n\nAs the intensity ramps up with each passing wave, your ammunition dwindles, and the zombies become increasingly aggressive and numerous. It's a test of endurance, reflexes, and nerves as you strive to hold out against the relentless tide of the undead.\n\nHow long can you survive in this nightmarish world? Will you become a legend of resilience, or will you join the ranks of the shambling horde? The choice is yours in this pulse-pounding VR experience that pushes the boundaries of fear and excitement.",
