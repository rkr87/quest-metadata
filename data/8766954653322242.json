        "description": "Explore the environments, find the gears and solve the puzzles to escape. \nGear Out is a tense and immersive interactive escape-room puzzle game. You must search for gears, interact with obstacles and arrange the gears on spindles to open the door to the next level. But beware, youâ€™re not always in there alone.\nThere are 26 levels of increasing difficulty. Some have time limits, some have additional challenges. Each level can be randomized to produce up to 9,999 variants of the puzzle for extended play time.\nPlayable from seated, standing or room scale environments. Also playable with either one or both controllers.\n",
