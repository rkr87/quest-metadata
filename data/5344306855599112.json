        "description": "Outta Hand is a high-energy platforming adventure that lets you embody one of the Hand-People, wide-eyed, hop-happy lab experiments with the power to jump great heights, leap impossible lengths, and shake hands from… really, really far away. Like a whole big dining room away.\n\nDue to not being dumb enough, loveable as you are, Dr. Vendelvom has selected you for immediate termination. Not like fired gone, more like dead gone.\n \n![{\"height\":200,\"type\":\"image\",\"width\":1280}](https://scontent.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/38974593_385462667223920_4745442397331988436_n.png?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6e7a0a&_nc_ohc=QemO-_fS_nUAX8snL4U&_nc_ht=scontent.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AfDR32-A6ya7Q-zC9-23ScB8gyxwwcn8Eyn3uhOk89A1Iw&oe=65BBF1C0)\nTo save yourself and your brethren, you must platform, jump, bounce, and punch your way through the evil doctor’s laboratory, to take down him and all his baddies. With multiple levels and boss fights along with an endless mode, things might get, shall we say, a little bit “out of hand?” Get it?! No? Fine…\n\n![{\"height\":200,\"type\":\"image\",\"width\":1280}](https://scontent.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/38982552_7538295506215748_1655078945646937211_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6e7a0a&_nc_ohc=b9MyycjCh8UAX_Wy665&_nc_ht=scontent.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AfDsoTizVFkKXSgw79pKKOpzZyzc_7pbF7c2WZEv4xLPiQ&oe=65BB936D)\n\nWith the latest Avatar Update, you can now jump into the skin of one of your rescued brethren for a wonderfully different embodied experience!\n\n**Outta Hand:**\n\n* Is an arm-swinging platformer with an exhilarating movement mechanic paired with a humorous light narrative.\n* Let you explore 37 levels to traverse and several mega-bosses to punch!\n* An endless run mode in two flavors for infinite hours of fun!\n* Gives you plenty of movement comfort settings to fit your playstyle.\n\nPlease note that while the game does support seated gameplay, we recommend standing up and ensuring you have plenty of room to swing your arms within the guardian and with no objects within arm's length!\n\n{361285276515327}",
