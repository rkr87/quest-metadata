(Playing a match from start to finish rewards more XP than starting midway through a match).\n- Unlocks can be equippped from the Loadout tab in the Office Space menu.\n\n\n## Questions? Feeback?

However, when a grenade hits a map obstacle, its gravity will change to match the surface it hit. Sound confusing? Try it out!\n- Lastly, you can blow yourself up so BE CAREFUL! \n\n### Locomotion Collision Fixes\n- A major overhaul to the physics of our locomotion system when moving both with thumbsticks and real-world movement.\n- Players should no longer get stuck on stairs.\n- Thumbstick rotation pivot should now be located directly at the player's feet\n- The locomotion collider should no longer become separated from the player's real-world position.\n\n### \"Arm-O-Mat\" Weapons Cache\n- In Team Deathmatch there is now a place to pick up any of the game's weapons directly in front of the player spawn.\n\n## Questions?

Releasing the buttons will hide it.\n- A match log is now available on the right side of the in-game menu, displaying kills and objectives as they happen.\n- You can now see your teammate's name badge through walls, and names are color coded by team.\n\n# Got feedback?

We are still in the middle of debugging this, so we would appreciate any feedback regarding leaderboard accuracy.\n! While debugging this new implementation, we found some ancient MVP rewarding bugs that attributed MVPs to the wrong player's Player Stats.\n  For this reason MVP counts have been reset.\n! Best Match Score has also been reset due to changes in our scoring algorithms.\n\n### MVP Reward Effect\n- If a player receives MVP in a match, the MVP badge will appear above their head in the Results Room.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed an MVP accounting error in the Player Stats API.\n\n# Got feedback?

One caveat is that this does have a non-trivial performance overhead. First generation Quest users are already effected by the rendering overhead that is mainly caused by the Warp Scope feature. While this update will improve locomotion in most situations we are still working on bringing parity to the Quest 1 experience. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\n### Gravity Pistol\nEarly players and testers (and unlucky players who may have glitched into our test environment) may remember that the default pistol's projectiles used to ricochet off of obstacles. We've re-implemented this feature and adjusted the pistol's radiation cost to give the old standard its own gimmicky gunplay.\n\n### Parameter Adjustments\n- Faster respawn for both human player and bots.\n- 2 minute domination time for all domination maps.\n\n### Tutorial Adjustment\n- Adjusted text instructions and environment assets in the \"Using the Wrist Device\" step of the tutorial in hopes of clearing up where players need to go and what they need to do. \n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed a bug which caused some players to get locked into a black screen when starting the tutorial from the Office Space menu when they have inadequate internet connection.\n- Fixed a bug by which players wouldn't be able to complete the tutorial if they skipped certain steps.\n\n# Got feedback?

If this is something you feel strongly about please let us know in our Discord server's #feedback channel.\n\n### Custom Games\n- If a player enters an unused 4-digit room code after clicking the \"Use a Room Code\" button they can also choose or randomize which game mode and map they will start in.\n\n### Smooth Turning\nSeveral reviewers and community members have requested Smooth Turning as an immersion feature, but also more importantly as an accessibility feature, so we've added this option to the game.\n\n- A 'Turning Mode' toggle has been added to the Options tab in the office space menu allowing the player to select between 'Snap' and 'Smooth'.\n- If Smooth turning is toggled, you can adjust its speed with the 'Smooth Turn Speed' toggle.\n\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed a bug that caused teams to get stacked if too many players join the same match at exactly the same time.\n- Fixed a bug that caused players to spawn in the same spawn point.\n\n# Got feedback?

This allows for more free traversal on the reverse-Y plane.\n- Some additional lighting elements were added to help add points of interest for stage navigation.\n\nParameter Adjustments\n- Respawn time has been reduced by 30%\n- Overheat time has been reduced by 40%\n- Bullet hit boxes are slightly smaller (10cm -> 7.5 cm radius) to allow passage through narrow areas, especially useful for the Targeting Pistol. This also means that bullets should be slightly easier to dodge.\n\nMinor Visual Adjustments\n- Lightmaps and fog have been adjusted for map readability\n- The glowing border on the Warp Scope has been made thicker and brighter so it is easier to distinguish between the Warp Scope and the player's primary field of vision. \n- Miscellaneous aesthetic adjustments\n\nBugs\n- A bug where the head-tracked UIs (First Spawn dialog, Respawn dialog, Elimination dialog) moved choppily while walking has been fixed."
