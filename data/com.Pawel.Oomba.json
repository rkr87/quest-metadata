        "description": "Oomba Pops VR game features cute alien animals, Oombas and Blumbas running around collecting points by popping alien Pops. The point values of each Pop depend on their colors. Yellow is worth 10 points while Magenta gives 60 points.\n\nPlayer controls Oomba with the headset projecting a laser beam and a white dot. (It is as if using a laser pointer attached to a helmet while playing with a dog). Each session lasts slightly over a minute. There are 3 levels of difficulties. Depending on the level, your Oomba competes against one, two or three Blumbas.\n\nBoth Oombas and Blumbas have 6 legs each. Oombas have 3 legs in the front and 3 in the back, while Blumbas have 3 legs on each side. Oombas and Blumbas may be related, but it is a mystery as to the exact nature of their relationship, since the world where they exist was not created as by the strict, trial-and-error rules set forth by the Grandpa Darwin.\n\nMusic by Alexandra Bodytko",
