        "description": "This cinematic experience takes you on a short but intense journey towards the appreciation of a conscious existence.\n\nYou are gifted every moment with life's most precious achievement: A conscious mind, enabling you to sense and hold within, the universe's boundless beauty - a source of infinite inspiration that fuels your inner space.\n\nOur way of thinking about life influences our perception of the world around us. False priorities can act like blinders and make us overlook the ever-present beauty of the universe, which can be our greatest source of energy and inspiration. A positive and grateful mindset enables us to harvest that energy to fuel our inner space and retain well-being. With this virtual-reality experience I express my own appreciation for and feelings about the gift of life. We need keep our ability to see the world through the wondering eyes of a child.\n\n",
