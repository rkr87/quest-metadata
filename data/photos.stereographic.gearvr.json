        "description": "Even amongst virtual reality enthusiasts, most people donâ€™t realize that the first 3D viewer was developed in 1838 by Charles Wheatstone - almost 180 years ago! Since before the popularization of television, radio, cinema, or virtual reality, people have been exploring the world through immersive stereo 3D images. From the invention of the stereoscope up through the mid 20th century, hundreds of thousands of stereographic photos cards were produced and distributed all over the world. Though nearly forgotten, these photo cards can again be viewed as intended, thanks to the advent of mobile VR.",
