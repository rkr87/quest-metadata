        "description": "Armed with a battery hungry flashlight, you find yourself exploring what appears to be a quiet average looking home in a woodsy neighborhood. Before long, you discover you’re not alone as you discover the clues unraveling the horrifying mystery of what’s gone on in this house and struggle to survive the terror that hunts you.\n\nFor an even more terrifying experience, switch to the highly popular VR Mode which immerses you in the environment using minimum Room Scale combined with our Immersive Movement Role-play System (IMRS). After the tutorial, you're on your own. Zero onscreen directions or HUD in your face, you’re never taken out of the immersion.",
