This is to stop accidentally grabbing the puzzle when aligning pieces.\n\nPieces now need to be a little closer to your hand when grabbing to reduce the chance of accidentally grabbing the wrong piece. Remote grab works as before.\n\nJigsaws with small pieces will require you to be closer to the target destination before they start to drift into position.\n\nSnapping 3d pieces into place does not require as much precision regarding the angle of pieces when joining them in your hands or when adding to a sphere when the outlines have been hidden.\n\nIf you find any issues please report to brett@headstartdesign.co.uk"

This directs you to my website in the Oculus browser where you can download photos (also a link to Flick with thousands more to download). Once downloaded, you can browse to the files from within the game and add them to the photo selection screen.\n\n** Tray improvements**\nWhile holding the X or A buttons you can now drag pieces around the tray or return a grabbed piece to the tray. This means you don’t need to swap between build and arrange modes any more. I’ve also doubled the tray resolution to show more detail in the pieces.\n\n** Usability improvements **\nWhile holding a piece you can now use your thumbstick to move the piece closer or further from your hand. Some people don’t like the pieces being offset from your hand so this should help.\nThe “lying down mode” has been completely recoded and is now a more versatile “reclining mode”. This allows you to get comfortable in any position and then click a button to realign the tray and puzzle to a suitable angle and position.\n\nI hope you enjoy the game :)\n\nPlease report any issues to brett@headstartdesign.co.uk\n"
