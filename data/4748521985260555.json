        "description": "This stone chapel, a reconstruction of an ancient Byzantine church in ancient Cappadocia, was built on the Lanier Theological Library grounds. Based on photos of church ruins taken by Gertrude Bell in 1909 that are now stored at Newcastle University, as well as a later analysis published at Harvard, it is a testimony to church history as well as Christian and Jewish scriptures. This model brings the beauty and majesty of the chapel to the user in an incredible immersive application. With access to faithful reproduction of physical elements and on-demand commentary and translations, the user experiences the modern structure, the ancient ruins on which it is based, and the incredible interior artwork, in a way that only Virtual Reality can provide.",
