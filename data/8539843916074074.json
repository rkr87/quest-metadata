        "description": "In Black Hole Rush, the universe is on the brink of collapse as relentless waves of enemies seek to destroy everything in their path. Your mission is to stop them by harnessing the immense power of a black hole. Using VR controls, players grab, throw, and launch enemies into the ever-hungry void, banishing them from existence. The game combines intense action with strategic positioning as players must manage increasing enemy numbers and more powerful foes in later stages. With immersive VR gameplay, players feel the gravity of each decision, using their environment and quick thinking to manipulate the battlefield. Black holes are not only your weapon but also your greatest ally. However, beware, as one wrong move could send you spiraling into the abyss as well. Each level introduces new enemy types, abilities, and environmental challenges, making for a constantly evolving experience that keeps players on edge. Will you have what it takes to master the power of the black hole and save the galaxy from total annihilation?",
