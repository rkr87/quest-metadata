        "description": "Based on the sci-fi short story by Philip K. Dick, The Great C is a cinematic narrative set in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event. Featuring a thrilling storyline, stunning environments and a powerful soundtrack, the viewer is transported to a desolate landscape in which the remnants of humanity are ruled by an all-powerful supercomputer known as the Great C. Each year, the nearby village is forced to send a young person on a pilgrimage to appease the mysterious machine, a journey from which no one ever returns. The Great C follows Clare, a young woman who finds her life upended when her fiancé is summoned for this year’s pilgrimage. Leaving the safe confines of her village, Clare must decide whether to accept the rules of her harsh society or fight against the oppressive powers that created it. The Great C is a sweeping 30+ minute experience, developed from the ground up to push the boundaries of storytelling in VR. Official selection of the Venice Film Festival.",
