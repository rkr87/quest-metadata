        "description": "Steps of Privilege (Beta) is an interactive VR experience that provides a safe space to explore the nuances of privilege and foster the discussion around diversity, equity & inclusion.\n\nIn this fundamental, yet powerful, experience, users listen to 20 statements and move forward or backward if the statement applies to them. For example, If you studied the culture of your ancestors in elementary school, take one step forward, and so on. This exercise provides people with a unique opportunity to understand and reflect on the intricacies of their own privilege in a safe and judgment-free environment, while not exploiting the stories of others. People are also given the opportunity to experience and contribute to a community collected, call-to-action idea board through saved audio recordings.\n\nEngaging with Steps of Privilege increases cultural competence and emotional intelligence, and empowers users to leverage their position within a social structure to work for social justice.",
