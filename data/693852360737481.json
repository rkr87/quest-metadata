        "description": "Experience a new kind of immersive horror in Dreadhalls!\n\nYou are trapped deep inside a massive dungeon. Explore it, survive it, and find a way to escape. Your only weapons will be stealth, your own courage, and a faint light.\n\nInspired by the survival horror and roguelike genres, Dreadhalls has been terrorizing people ever since its debut at the 2013 Oculus + Indiecade VR Jam.\n\nDreadhalls is an intense and scary experience, not for the faint of heart. You have been warned!",
