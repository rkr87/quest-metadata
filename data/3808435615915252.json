        "description": "Throwing Punches is a boxing game where you can punch your opponents from a distance. Throw your punches and control them in flight while dodging enemy attacks. It can be a real workout! You can slow down time if the situation gets out of control.\n\nGo through 12 levels consisting of 4 stages each as fast as you can to stand at the top of the leaderboards!\n\nTest yourself in Endless Random mode - whether you clear the stage or not - you never know what comes next!\n\nExperiment with modifiers - make your fists go faster, disable gravity, or change the slow motion controls!\n\nNow with three ways to control slow motion: manual, \"if you move, time moves\" and \"time slows down when bullets are nearby\"",
