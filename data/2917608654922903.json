        "description": "Step into the world of Spice and Wolf, recreated in VR by the original creators of the popular anime and light novel series. \nAnime is now not just something you watchâ€”it's something you experience!\n\n# Story\nKraft Lawrence is a traveling merchant in a medieval world, who one day comes across Holo, a wolf deity taking the form of a girl. After a string of adventures, Holo decides to follow Lawrence along.\n\nHolo and Lawrence's journeys were not without troubles; one such case was when they were caught by surprise in a sudden thunderstorm. Running from the rain, the two find shelter in an abandoned water mill in the woods. As they gather around a small fire and wait for the sky to clear, a sweet and curious story unfolds...an all-new story that you will experience firsthand, from Lawrence's point of view.\n\n# Production Staff\nStory by Isuna Hasekura\nCharacter Design by Ju Ayakura\nVoice of Holo by Ami Koshimizu\nVoice of Lawrence by Jun Fukuyama",
