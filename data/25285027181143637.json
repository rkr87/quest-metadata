        "description": "Sideways Runners is a competitive multiplayer VR game that innovatively uses hand-driven locomotion. This game sets itself apart by not featuring a traditional racing mode, instead focusing on a variety of game modes that range from casual play to more structured formats like paintball, along with the exciting addition of user-created minigames.\n\nPlayers can engage in different game modes that cater to varying levels of competitiveness and skill. While the game allows for the creation of custom minigames, these cannot be shared globally; instead, players must invite others to join them directly for private sessions. This feature adds a personal touch to the gameplay, as players can craft unique experiences and then compete or collaborate directly with friends or other enthusiasts they invite.\n\nThe competitive spirit of Sideways Runners is further enhanced by its daily reward system, where players earn 100 in-game currency each day they log on. This currency can be spent on a variety of cosmetic items, allowing players to personalize their avatars with different skins, accessories, and animations, enhancing their identity in the game's vibrant virtual world.\n\nSideways Runners stands out by offering a physically engaging, strategy-oriented VR experience with a diverse range of gameplay options, fostering both community involvement and competitive fervor.",
