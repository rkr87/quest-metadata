        "description": "Within the Fortress is an archery action - tower defense game. Armed with a bow and arrows, you will get the unique experience of traveling back in time to defend historical fortresses from a siege. The destiny of the fortress lies in your hands as you will have to take down waves of enemies that try to break into the fortress, but watch out and take cover because some of them are armed with bows & arrows as well. Luckily, you will not always be alone, as you continue taking enemies down you will get the chance to activate perks, like other archers that can help you out when things start getting tough.\n\nYou will travel back in time and defend well-known fortresses like the Viennese Hofburg, the Salzburg Hohenwerfen, and Hohensalzburg medieval castles. Each fortress offers a unique experience with historical backgrounds and different challenges you will have to face. In the beginning, you will be able to learn and practice how to defend a small Fortress, but as you reach certain milestones other Levels will be unlocked.\n\nWith every enemy you take down, you get points and the game's difficulty increases, and while the beginning of each round might seem easy for you, it won`t take long until you find yourself asking for help and using the points earned to activate perks to help you out. LetÂ´s see how long you can survive.",
