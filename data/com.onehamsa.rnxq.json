        "description": "Racquetball meets Breakout inside a giant pinball machine! \n\nRacket: Nx is a new kind of game that challenges the limits of what you can do with a racket and ball in VR. \n\nThe game features:\n- 2 single player modes - a campaign and an endless runner.\n- Competitive multiplayer supporting cross platform.\n- A sick OST and the option to play your own music in game!\n- Cross Buy with the Rift.\n\nThe game is played inside a giant glass dome, the walls of which light up with targets you must destroy with the ball.\nBut this is no ordinary ball. \nHit it with force and it will slam into the wall, rolling across it and bulldozing everything in its path. \nUse your racket's tractor beam to pull it back, or simply to line up your next shot exactly where you want it. \n\nTargets appear in Waves, and your goal is to destroy them all before your energy runs out. But targets aren't the only thing in the arena. \n\nSo be quick, accurate and smart. Plan your shots well. Learn to control the ball to perfection.",
