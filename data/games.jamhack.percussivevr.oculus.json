Sure to be your new favorite, the vibraphone is the first of our instruments to support a sustain pedal‚Äîwhich can be activated either using grip buttons or supported USB pedal devices.\n\nüè† New Environment Layout:\n\nTo make the experience better with more play spaces and tracking configurations, and to optimize overall performance, we‚Äôve taken a fresh look at how the environment is arranged and made navigation easier than ever. Instead of teleporting around a large room, you‚Äôll now stay in one place and let the instrument come to you. You can change instruments using the new and improved menu system!\n\n‚è±Ô∏è Metronome Customization:\n\nIf the experimental metronome from our previous release wasn‚Äôt quite your tempo, you can now customize it using the menu! Simply switch to the Metronome tab to adjust the volume, tempo, and number of beats ‚Äî and leave the duts to us!\n\nüëê Experimental Four Mallet Mode:\n\nIt‚Äôs now possible to play with four mallets! Use triggers to adjust the mallet intervals while you play.\n\nüéß Adjustable Reverb:\n\nUse the new Settings tab in the menu to adjust the reverb effect to your liking. It even goes to eleven!\n\nüëä Improved Hit Detection:\n\nSay goodbye to ghost notes! Triggers have been updated for all instruments to make hit detection more consistent and reliable.\n\nüéº Better Sheet Music Import:\n\nExpanding on the beta sheet music importer from before, sheet music can now be organized into sub-folders. The previous convention of keeping images in the top level with numeric suffixes is still supported, too! More improvements here are still to come. Additionally, you can now scroll left and right to switch to the previous/next pages on the music stand.\n\nüîÆ Future Updates:\n\nWhich features or improvements do you want to see the most? We'd love to hear from you!"
