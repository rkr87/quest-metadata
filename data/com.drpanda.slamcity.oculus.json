        "description": "We're going to create a sports world where players can choose athletes from different backgrounds to gain energy in different sports.\nBasketball is our first step in building the world, and in SlamCity's basketball world, players can complete the game with a realistic basketball experience such as dribbling, shooting, slamming, breaking, stealing, blocking, and more.\nThere are two ways to play in the current basketball world: free practice and 1v1 bullfighting.\nFree Practice: Here players can practice their basketball skills and increase their proficiency in the operation. After mastering the skills such as breaking through the layup, breaking through the slam dunk, breaking through the back side step three-pointer, and pulling the rod to change hands to the layup, you will gain the dominant position in the next 1v1 bullfight.\n1v1 Bullfight: A real-life 1v1 basketball challenge where you play against a real player. You need to prepare in the preparation circle first, and once both of you have completed the preparation, you can enter the 1v1 challenge.\nProtect the basketball at all times during the challenge, and you can open your other hand to protect it in front of you, which can reduce the probability of being stealed. By pressing the left joystick, you can use the Breakthrough Acceleration skill, which makes you more agile and easier to get rid of others.",
