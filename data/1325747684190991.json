        "description": "Zoo Park was developed for you to see the animals on their natural environment with the beautiful graphics and sounds. \n\nUsing your virtual reality glasses, you can see the animals moving closely with animations. It will be an exciting journey for you. \n\nYou don't need to go to a zoo to see the animals. Your children will also enjoy the virtual simulations as if they are in a zoo and know the names of many animals. Elephant, Lion, Lioness, Zebra, Crocodile, Hippopotamus, Rhinoceros, Chicken, Cow, Goat, Pig, Sheep, Bear, Boar, Fox, Rabbit, Stag, Wolf, Crow and more.\n\nHow to play\nIt is very easy. You should look at where you want to move. When you approach to animals, your movements will be slower or stop so that you will have time to examine them closely. You can use touchpad to go forward, back, left and right.\n\nFeatures\n- Very beautiful graphics. Realistic forest environment\n- Nice animated animals in Zoo\n- Natural sounds of animals",
