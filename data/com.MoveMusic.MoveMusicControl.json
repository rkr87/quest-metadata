        "description": "Make Music with Movement! MoveMusic Control is a VR MIDI controller that lets you wirelessly control music software on another computer by interacting with a 3D environment you create. Bring expressive, full-body movement to your digital music workflow with this performance-oriented controller that helps you show an audience your music through movement. Use custom 3D controls to create in interesting ways and explore novel sonic possibilities. Supports Passthrough so you can see the world around you while performing in mixed reality. Use our advanced controller building system to customize your 3D MIDI controller. Save your project files to open later or share with a friend.\n\nNOTE: MIDI features require connection to a computer with MIDI-capable software (e.g. DAW such as Ableton Live). Computer must be capable of a Wi-Fi connection and be able to run the MMConnect companion app (see movemusic.com/downloads).",
