        "description": "The \"Augmented Food Exposure\" app allows mental health professionals to measure that specific negative emotional response, called \"emotional eating\", which leads to bingeing episodes in certain eating disorders, such as bulimia and binge eating. The app provides not only exposure to different virtual foods presented within 2 virtual environments, but also to interact with hands or joypads. The patient is first invited to evaluate his craving or craving response level with respect to virtual foods, determining an emotional response hierarchy, in which the 13 foods that elicit greater activation within the 2 available immersive environments are selected. Subsequently, within 6 sessions, the professional will measure the patient's emotional response, starting from the food that determines a reaction of lesser intensity, up to that of greater intensity, using a 5-dimensional Likert scale.",
