        "description": "Challenge your friends to different match types including exhibition, or professional (coming soon) ranked fights where your reputation, stats, virtual cash, and boxerâ€™s title is on the line. \n\nEOC is a physically demanding game that will push you to improve your cardio and your core. But you'll need some space to add this energetic workout to your routine. Make sure you have at least 1.5m by 2m of unobstructed space to swing and then tell your family members to stand back - WAY back. Or better yet, pick up another headset and challenge them to a no-impact, no-holds-barred grudge match to prove your unconditional supremacy! (separate VR rooms highly recommended)\n\nWe want to stress that EOC is currently Early Access and we are looking for your feedback, so if you love boxing and don't mind giving us a glove (er hand), we're all ears about how we can make this game the best that it can possibly be. \n\nBE AWARE BEFORE BUYING:\n\n- NO THUMBSTICK CONTROLS - this is intentional. Use your body to move around your space, to dodge, weave, etc.\n\n- PVP ONLY - while there are some basic solo training features, the core of the game is its multiplayer aspect. It may be very difficult to find opponents via the Quickmatch feature until the game builds an audience online. So our recommendation in these early days is to be sure you pick up EOC with a friend so you have someone reliable to battle while our player base builds and the game matures.",
