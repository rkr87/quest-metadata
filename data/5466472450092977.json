        "description": "The Train360 app was developed by a passionate group of tech enthusiasts, storytellers, and innovators committed to creating immersive training solutions that help save lives.  VR sims help learners move beyond basic safety compliance skills to develop: \n\nVisual literacy & hazard recognition skills: Allow learners the opportunity to develop identification, see past normal working conditions, and then bring that fresh perspective back into their workplace.\n\nSelf-awareness & confidence skills:  Each training simulation is developed to support Total Worker Safetyâ„¢. Learners that are self-aware, empowered, and skilled in recognizing potential hazards are foundational elements to building a strong company culture.\n\nThe Train360 app is a FREE download. The VR simulations that accompany the Train360 app can only be accessed by entering a 4-6 digit Learning Code associated with the My Virtual Safety Trainer (MVST) eLearning courses.
