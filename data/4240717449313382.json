        "description": "2021 NOTE : Have had some bugs flagged which explains the bad reviews, this was a project upgrade and port to App Lab so I could work on new stuff - please be patient while I resolve :)\n\nHave you ever wished that wherever you were you could just dig a hole? Have you ever lost a rental deposit for digging too many holes in the backyard? What about ruining a camping trip because someone sprained their ankle after standing in a hole you dug in the middle of the night.\n\nIf so, Digging Simulator is for you!\n\nDigging Simulator lets you dig infinite holes, using your skill, power and technique to cleave and shape the earth. As you progress you gain new tools, and learn new ways to make your mark on the benighted ground.\n\n - Virtual Reality digging game - (currently available on quest)\n - Strike terrain to dig and explore\n - Collect treasure and unlock the depths below\n - Discover new tools to make new holes, or power up old ones\n - VR trackers mean velocity and direction create your hole\n",

This was a concept build from 2019, that has had good feedback in the past and I would love to spend some more time on it, but pushing this build to fix the bugs identified now. \n\nKirby I'll definitely add smooth locomotion and climbing soon! ToxicFox you'll be able to save your hole (and a whole new dungeon) as soon as possible! I'm working on a new system inside another project that I'll bring in to this too, so can make much more cool stuff! \n\nThanks everyone for your patience."
