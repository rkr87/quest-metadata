        "description": "Jump into a Musical Journey, where you only need your hands to create awesome music! Mix samples and combine music to your liking, from blues to trap.  You can also learn about the history of instruments and genres, as different musical styles have developed thanks to migration.\nYou can learn more about three historical periods - Chicago in the 1940s during the Great Migration, the migration of Jamaicans to the US and the UK during the 1960s, and finally the forced migration from Syria during the Civil War in the 2010s. Each of these periods has a special location in a game, where you can find samples of their local music. By combining these samples, you unlock more modern samples to make new music and learn about the connection between the new and the older genres. \nMusical Journey is easy to pick up and everybody can start making awesome music from the first moment!",
