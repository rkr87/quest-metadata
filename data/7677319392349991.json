Showcase your driving skills, control your speed, and become the champion of retro racing tracks! The game offers three different modes, each allowing you to explore various aspects of racing and drifting.\n\nThe first mode is Drift, where you can test your drifting skills with an RC model and achieve the highest score possible. Practice your drifting techniques, find the perfect angles, and perform the most impressive tricks on the track.\n\nThe second mode is Free Ride. This mode allows you to drive your car freely around the track without any time constraints or objectives. It's the perfect opportunity to explore the track, learn its twists and turns, and simply enjoy the ride.\n\nThe final mode is F1 Race, where you race against the clock.

This mode offers a true racing challenge, where you can compare your times with others and strive for constant improvement.\n\nTrack Racer thus provides you with the opportunity to experience different styles of racing, from precise drifting to relaxed free driving to intense time trials. Get ready for an unforgettable experience in the world of virtual reality!",
