        "description": "\"‘Captain Toonhead Might Be The Most Over-The-Top VR Game Ever\"\n- VRScout\n\n\"One of the best tower defense games I have played in VR.\"\n- VRGameFaqs\n\n*An ACTION TOWER DEFENSE*\nYou'll move all over the map, hammering away to upgrade towers, throwing over-powered chanclas recklessly and taking control of your towers to unleash streams of heavy-metal powered hot sauce and shoot electric beams from weaponized pizza at your enemies. \n\n*The hero we got stuck with*\nAfter the squad sent by the World Treaty for Freedom (WTF) got fried in the \"burrito incident\", it falls to Elliott Salazar, the cartoon-obsessed space janitor and only survivor, to save Earth. There’s a new captain onboard: Captain ToonHead! \n\n*Balance action and strategy*\nShooting alone will not defeat the waves of Cyber-C.H.I.C.K.E.N.s and Terra-S.H.A.R.K.s. Combine those PIGñata tower bombs with your chancla throws in a very strategic way if you want to save the EnerCubes and defeat Nicholas Voorhees' P.U.N.K. army!",
