        "description": "Welcome to Openlab!\n\nOpenlab recreates virtual work environments such as chemistry, biology, physics, and mechanics labs where students can develop their practical skills by performing work protocols and practical techniques specific to each discipline.\n\nOpenlab allows trainees to use their hands to manipulate objects in the virtual environment, making the simulation more realistic and immersive. This can help trainees develop a better understanding of how to perform specific tasks or use equipment in real-life scenarios.\n\n\nSAFE EXPERIMENTATION\nMany laboratory activities have been banned due to their danger to students. With Openlab, virtual experiments can be carried out using toxic raw materials and dangerous machinery.\n\nLATEST EQUIPMENT\nLaboratory experiences require tools that become obsolete over time. For this reason, practical activities represent an increasingly high cost for schools. Openlab ensures cutting-edge instrumentation at reduced costs.\n\nEXPERIENCE IMMERSION\nShrink down to the size of a molecule to understand its structure and properties. With Openlab, you can do that! Get immersed in a test tube during a reaction, interact with the structure of DNA, and discover the microscopic world.\n",
