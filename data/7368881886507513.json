So feel free to carry your words around with you as far as you like. :)\n- Improved overall interactions and various QoL fixes.\n\nv0.1.52\n- Fixed issue where after setting up Physics mode the playspace would vanish in some instances.\n\nv0.1.51\n- You can now use controllers in Physics mode!\n- Fixed issue where if you got to Classic 60 (C4-60) the mode would break and set itself to C5 even though C4 is the final stage. (Thanks to @HBR)\n- Fixed issue with Subgram 11 (S0-11) missing a letter. (Thanks to @HBR)\n\nv0.1.50\n- Physics mode: on boot the game will give you two options, SNAP or PHYSICS. Now with PHYSICS the cubes will fall onto a pre-defined surface area instead of snapping into a dock. Great for playing on a table, or even a floor!\n- Revised UI: The UI has been cleaned up and simplified so that it not only performs better but is easier to navigate.\n- Performance improvements: The game now runs much more smoothly on all devices, and hits a stable 90FPS on Quest 3 in passthrough. You'd think it would be easy with such a simple looking game, but passthrough really eats CPU for breakfast.\n- I've also removed access to SETTINGS during a level. It was getting a bit messy changing settings in the middle of a level, so now you need to return to the main menu to make any settings changes.\n\nv0.1.30\n- Update Meta SDK to (v65)\n- Improved overall visual quality. Test is now sharper, shapes are smoother.\n- Improved overall performance, hand tracking and interactions.\n- Various smaller bug fixes.\n\nv0.1.23\n- Manual controls! You can now disable the ability to grab the puzzle frame and use buttons instead to rotate the puzzle. Found under SETTINGS -> OPTIONS.\n\nv0.1.22\n- Added a Word of the Day game mode where a new word will appear every day. Great for just jumping in for a quick session every day. \n- Added 2 new Achievements: 30 and 90 day Word of the Day streaks.\n- Improvement German words. Mostly focusing on the 3 letter words first to remove any particles and have only meaningful words included in the dataset.\n\nv0.1.21\n- Fixed bug in Classic that would prevent the level from loading if no language had been selected before. Now the default in English!\n- Improved Spanish word dictionnary, as previously there were too many particles especially in the 3 letter levels. Thanks for the help on this!\n\nV0.1.20\n- Added 3 new puzzle languages: French, German and Spanish. This is a work in progress!\n- Other languages than English only have CLASSIC mode for now, and do not have definitions.\n- Languages all have their own saves, even in ZEN mode.\n- A new language option is now under SETTINGS. You cannot toggle language mid-level ^^.\n- Cleaned up UI in SETTINGS to make it more consistent with the rest.\n\nv0.1.13\n- Added a wrist watch option to keep track of remaining time and lives. For those of you who like to take a walk around your homes with the puzzle! ^^\n- Moved TUTORIAL and WATCH buttons under OPTIONS in the SETTINGS menu.\n- Reduced the puzzle frame grabbable padding size to help reduce accidentally grabbing it when trying to grab letters.\n- Fixed issue in SUBGRAM where is the group of letters had duplicates, both the duplicates would be removed when that letter is the connecting letter.\n- Fixed issue where you could switch ZEN MODE on/off during a level. Please return to menu before switching!\n\nv0.1.12:\n- Integrated a entirely new dataset for words. There's now roughly 3x more words in all modes!\n- As part of the new dataset there's also now definitions for all words after you have spelt them correctly. Enjoy learning new words!\n- There is now a confirmation to return to the menu, for those of you accidentally pressing the MENU button mid-level.\n- As requested by many of you, the puzzle grid now only returns to it's original position if you return to the menu and not between levels (for example when you press NEXT or RETRY).\n\nPro tip: You can keep playing the same levels even after you have finished them, as they will show different words each time."

If you can remember to leave a review it'll really help.\n\nv0.1.30\n- Update Meta SDK to (v65)\n- Improved overall visual quality. Test is now sharper, shapes are smoother.\n- Improved overall performance, hand tracking and interactions.\n- Various smaller bug fixes.\n\nv0.1.23\n- Manual controls! You can now disable the ability to grab the puzzle frame and use buttons instead to rotate the puzzle. Found under SETTINGS -> OPTIONS.\n\nv0.1.22\n- Added a Word of the Day game mode where a new word will appear every day. Great for just jumping in for a quick session every day. \n- Added 2 new Achievements: 30 and 90 day Word of the Day streaks.\n- Improvement German words. Mostly focusing on the 3 letter words first to remove any particles and have only meaningful words included in the dataset.\n\nv0.1.21\n- Fixed bug in Classic that would prevent the level from loading if no language had been selected before. Now the default in English!\n- Improved Spanish word dictionnary, as previously there were too many particles especially in the 3 letter levels. Thanks for the help on this!\n\nV0.1.20\n- Added 3 new puzzle languages: French, German and Spanish. This is a work in progress!\n- Other languages than English only have CLASSIC mode for now, and do not have definitions.\n- Languages all have their own saves, even in ZEN mode.\n- A new language option is now under SETTINGS. You cannot toggle language mid-level ^^.\n- Cleaned up UI in SETTINGS to make it more consistent with the rest.\n\nv0.1.13\n- Added a wrist watch option to keep track of remaining time and lives. For those of you who like to take a walk around your homes with the puzzle! ^^\n- Moved TUTORIAL and WATCH buttons under OPTIONS in the SETTINGS menu.\n- Reduced the puzzle frame grabbable padding size to help reduce accidentally grabbing it when trying to grab letters.\n- Fixed issue in SUBGRAM where is the group of letters had duplicates, both the duplicates would be removed when that letter is the connecting letter.\n- Fixed issue where you could switch ZEN MODE on/off during a level. Please return to menu before switching!\n\nv0.1.12:\n- Integrated a entirely new dataset for words. There's now roughly 3x more words in all modes!\n- As part of the new dataset there's also now definitions for all words after you have spelt them correctly. Enjoy learning new words!\n- There is now a confirmation to return to the menu, for those of you accidentally pressing the MENU button mid-level.\n- As requested by many of you, the puzzle grid now only returns to it's original position if you return to the menu and not between levels (for example when you press NEXT or RETRY).\n\nPro tip: You can keep playing the same levels even after you have finished them, as they will show different words each time."
