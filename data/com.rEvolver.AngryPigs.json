        "description": "Fight for your life and defend your precious crops in this action-packed shooter.\n\nUncle Frank went to visit his daughter in the city for the weekend. He accidentally forgot to feed his pigs. Pigs are hungry and are now running around the farm eating everything they find. \nHelp uncle Frank keep his crops by shooting piggies back to the barn. When you shoot a piggy, it returns to the barn, but be fast, thereâ€™s hundreds of them coming back to eat your precious crops. Watch out because they bite too. Keep away from those angry ones :)\n\nYou got three lives to begin with! Each piggy bite you lose a life. To restore life you can eat a donut. To eat it, just pick it up and place it in front of your mouth to eat.\nIf you're a beginner you might want to choose a difficulty level 1 where pigs are a bit slower and you have unlimited bullets.\n",
