                "change_log": "Major update for Call the Wizards!\nSince release, I've been listening to player feedback. So I've been hard at work improving the game, with a focus on 3 key areas:\n- Context: You have a better feeling of story, progress and achievement.\n- Clarity: You have a lot more information to make decisions.\n- Control: You have more control of your wizards and overall experience.\n\n\n\nHome World\n- All-new home world/level select, that feels like a real magical headquarters.\n- Completely changed how you choose and progress through levels.\n- There are now 3 items to collect: Stars, Books and Keys.\n- Stars unlock new worlds, so you can play levels in a different order.\n- Books unlock Ghost levels.\n- Keys unlock Boss levels.\n- The home office will be decorated with items as you finish levels and find items.\n- Added a preview image of a level and a checklist of what you need to do in the level.\n\n\n\nGhost Levels\n- Moved Ghost levels out of the main line. They are now optional.\n- Ghost levels reward you with more power in every level.\n- Added a special 'book' creep to every level; finding books lets you unlock ghost levels.\n- Added a Ghost Sack of Gold to every level; it's hittable after you pass Ghost Level 1.\n- Added a few Ghost Hats to every level; it's usable after you pass Ghost Level 2. Wizards placed on Ghost hats have infinite mana.\n- Soul Gems have a chance to drop on any level; they are usable after you pass Ghost Level 3.\n- Soul Wizards (Ghost, Hurricane, Inferno, Flood & Earthquake) can now be built on any level if you have unlocked Soul Gems.\n\n\n\nWizards\n- Added a 'Wizard' section to the home world, so you can learn about the wizards, with details on their strengths, weaknesses, and attack patterns. It clearly shows the 15 wizards you can build or unlock.\n- Levels do not automatically start after building a wizard, so you have more time to plan.\n- You can now control wizards while paused.\n- You can now move/swap wizards (no need to sell/rebuild).\n- Added a 'Wizcord' (aka Wizard Discord) popup for better storytelling and progression notifications.\n- Gems are instantly refunded when selling a wizard, instead of requiring you to collect them.\n- Ghost Wizard now applies stun.\n- Flood Wizard now applies slow.\n\n\n\nLevel Balance\n- All levels have been re-balanced to be slightly easier.\n- Some specific levels have been re-balanced to be significantly easier.\n- The final level was significantly rebalanced to be winnable without using Soul Gems.\n- Generally, if you find a level difficult, you now have more information, improved options while paused, alternative levels, and ghost unlocks to help you out.\n\n\n\nLevel General\n- Improved the visuals of the floating Level Menu.\n- Improved the background sky - it now changes to suit each level's theme.\n- One level was removed (Snow level) - due to having low quality design/art.\n- 'Grass' world levels have been recolored to look more vibrant and green.\n\n\n\nCreeps\n- You can now click a '?' button on any creep to see its name, HP, resistances, etc (while paused).\n- Fixed performance drops related to creep spawning.\n\n\n\nPlay Space\n- Improved app launch experience by removing the need to manually position your play space (now automatic).\n- You can now re-position and rotate your play space at any time - even during a level - through the settings menu.\n\n\n\nSettings\n- Added audio controls for All Sounds, Music and SFX.\n- Removed the terrain/clouds mixed reality feature, as it is unreliable.\n\n\n\nGeneral\n- Improved load time by about 50%.\n- Removed the 'fake' load screen so you get to the action faster.\n- Improved the initial splash screen with a \"Pinch/Click this\" outline gesture/hint.\n- Fixed a bug related to initial loading.\n- Improved the visuals of the hand/controller model.\n- General performance improvements.\n- General bug fixes."
