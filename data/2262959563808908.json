        "description": "The Baltic Settlers is the worldâ€™s first educational VR experience designed to teach the lifestyle of ancient Baltic tribes using an immersive approach.\n\nThis deceptively simple but clever single-player game will introduce you to three commonly performed crafts in Curonian tribe followed with an immersive quiz consisting of three witty tasks.\n\nTeleport back in time, watch closely how Curonianians perform their crafts and fill the quiz to become master of The Baltic Settlers.\n\nThe Baltic Settlers is designed to facilitate the learning process and raise curiosity about ancient Batic tribes. The content is approved by historians and archaeologists of the Talsi Regional Museum in Latvia, which holds the widest exposition of items from the time.\n\n\nIf you are interested in how to include this VR experience into the educational program let us know. We will gladly share how the Talsi Regional museum succeeded in building an educational course around the experience.",
