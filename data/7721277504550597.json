        "description": "Dive into virtual reality to experience the ancient charm of Korea. The VR Go-Stop game transcends a mere card game, transforming you into a time traveler through a portal. Based on the rules of traditional Korean Go-Stop, this game offers a new dimension of experience by blending tradition and modernity through cutting-edge virtual reality technology.\n\nThe moment you put on the headset, you find yourself seated on the floor of a traditional Korean Hanok house, with an opponent dressed in traditional Hanbok spreading out the Go-Stop mat in front of you. The realistic 3D environment and immersive audio give you the feeling of transcending time and space, as if you're truly in that era.\n\nThe gameplay is simple yet strategic. Using VR controllers, you select and throw cards, calculating scores. Each card is designed in a traditional Korean art style, allowing you to appreciate the beauty of Korean culture through the game.\n\nHowever, this game offers more than just playing Go-Stop. In virtual reality, you communicate with other players and immerse yourself in matches set against the backdrop of traditional Korean music and natural sounds. The VR Go-Stop game represents a perfect fusion of technology and tradition, introducing the charm of Korean culture to people around the world in a new way.\n\n\n■ It's a Korean traditional play in three different maps\n■ Two platers can enjoy multiplayer\n■ Play online with friends and other competitors\n■ Your own virtual avatar can be created",
