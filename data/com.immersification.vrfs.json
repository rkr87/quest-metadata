        "description": "VRFS is a community-driven football (soccer) simulator with a focus on realistic physics and competitive multiplayer.\n\nHere are the main features of VRFS:\n\nFOOTBALL PHYSICS SIMULATION: Players can perform almost any trick, from balancing the ball on the tip of their foot to executing curved power shots and long passes. The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine.\n\nCOMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for immediate response when a player touches the ball. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real football\n\nCOMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required.\n\nNO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.\n\nFREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project.\n\nPlease keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.",
