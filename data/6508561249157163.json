        "description": "Part puzzler, part farm-sim, part cyberpunk, part serious game.\nCyber Dose puts the player in the place of an AI databot in a newly created neural network within the HeXR Cloud System.\n\nYour role is to analyse and gather data on digital twins of illicit substance samples beamed in by AI health bots on Earth. \nYou will gain knowledge about each sample's molecular structure, manufacture and usage effects. This data must then be packaged and beamed back within a limited time frame to assist and educate humans about what the makeup of substances are before they consume them.\nContinue to collect data and learn in order to expand the neural network and increase the speed of data package delivery. \n\nBe sure to stay BOOSTED while completing tasks or you run the risk of crashing and entering bot rehab,  while human drug related harm continues to increase.\nIf too many countries reach extreme harm levels, you will be summoned by the Bot Integrity unit, or even worse, deregistered and shut down...",
