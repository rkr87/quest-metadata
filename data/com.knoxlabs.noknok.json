        "description": "NokNok puts recording front and center while including all the features and functions of a meeting and collaboration space.\n\nCreate your own room or NokNok yourself in. \n\nSolo or team, hereâ€™s what you can do:\n\nPodcasting Camera:\nUse our companion app to set points in space, and easily switch between different angles. Streams right to your pc with a built in recorder. \n\nAutopodcasting:\nThe camera will record those that are speaking automatically. This feature can record up to four people and a zoom out of everyone. So you can record just by yourself with ease. \n\nTeam Rooms:\nPersistent  rooms. Ideal for remote teams that want to have their own pocket dimension in VR. \n\nMemories:\nEasily send images and text from your browser to your avatar and vice/versa. This works like Dumbledore's pensive, take things out of your head like memories.\n\nBlackboards: \nBoards how they should be, when things were done the chalky way. Equipped with haptic feedback chalks.\n",
