Users will navigate two different labs and interact with 360 videos to learn more about what goes on at each facility. Research at PNNL’s Aquatic Research Laboratory and Marine Sciences Laboratory informs decisions for marine energy and hydropower. As you tour our facilities located in Richland, WA and Sequim, WA, you will get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the research currently being conducted to change the future of water power technologies.",
