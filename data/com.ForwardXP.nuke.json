        "description": "Please, Donâ€™t Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking button-pushing puzzle game. \n\nCovering for a colleague taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious console with a green screen monitor showing a pixelated live image of an unknown city. Also present is an ominous red button with the simple instruction to not touch anything! \n\nPush the red button once or press it many times. Your choices and actions will lead to outrageous and frightening consequences and over 30 unique puzzle endings.   \n\nScavenge the room for clues, tools, and buttons to solve riddles and trigger explosive events. This deceptively simple console has many mind-blowing surprises for you.\n\nThis updated version of the classic game features all new high-quality visuals, new mechanics, updated classic endings with new solutions, and a slew of new endings. \n\nGo ahead, press the button. You know you want to.",
