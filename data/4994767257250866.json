        "description": "Inspired by tabletop games, this game offers a unique blend of nostalgia and modern gameplay.\n\nTo get started, simply choose your teams, formations and options.\n\n You'll then be matched with another player online, and the game will begin. The goal is simple: outscore your opponent to be the ultimate winner.\n\nYou have the ability to tailor the gameplay to your liking by adjusting features like teams, formations, player size, game time, arena, ball properties which can affect the gameplay in various ways.\n\nAnd when it comes to controlling the action, you have options.\n You can play with your real hands using hand tracking technology, or you can use controllers for a more relaxed arcade experience. The choice is yours.\n\nJust be careful - hitting the ball into the net with your hands isn't as easy as it looks. You'll need to be precise and strategic in your movements to succeed.\n\nSo if you're ready to join the action, start playing now and experience the thrill of online soccer! ",
