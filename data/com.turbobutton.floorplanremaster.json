        "description": "The classic VR escape game is back by popular demand, with new graphics and features for Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3!\n\nFloor Plan Remastered is a short-form puzzle adventure that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets... all from the comfort of your elevator.\n\nFloor Plan takes most players about one hour to complete.
