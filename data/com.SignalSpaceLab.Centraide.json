        "description": "Jason is a young boy who escaped war with his family to take refuge in Canada yet still isn’t able to feel safe. Suzanne is a woman who has struggled with addiction and is still living with the consequences. Diane was a victim of childhood abuse and violence, events that continue to haunt her. What do these three people have in common? They have all received help from organizations supported by Centraide that allowed them to take back control of their lives. Through the true stories of Jason, Suzanne, and Diane, you’ll discover the challenges that pushed them to seek help and see how, when you show your local love, everyone can have an equal chance at success. Their stories are proof that issues of poverty and social exclusion are #UNIGNORABLE. \n\nFor more information, visit http://www.centraide-mtl.org/en/",
