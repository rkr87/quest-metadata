        "description": "What caused British soldiers to shoot into a crowd of British colonists on March 5, 1770? In this TimeSnap, players investigate the causes of the Boston Massacre by listening to historical figures, discovering primary sources, and asking probing questions. With evidence collected from significant sites across colonial Boston, players weigh competing perspectives, contextualize the events of March 5th, and construct a multi-factored explanation of the Boston Massacre.\n\nTimeSnap is a 20-30 minute experience designed for use in high school American history classrooms and includes full lesson plans and materials from the project website. It also makes for a great standalone experience for history buffs of any age.",
