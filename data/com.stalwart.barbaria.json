        "description": "Do you have what it takes to be the Mightiest in Barbaria?\n \nWelcome to a brutal world where visceral motion-controlled combat blends seamlessly with god-scale base-building and asynchronous multiplayer raids.\n\nUse fists, axes, swords, bows, rocks, or anything you can grab to dominate your foes in intense 1st-person combat. Then jump out to your immortal form and watch your minions carry on the battle while you rain down meteors from above. Systemic combat, versatile enemy AI, and player-created defences make every battle unique.\n\nBut remember, you aren’t the only Semigod in Barbaria! Attack other players’ realms to increase your Mightiness, and receive rewards when you successfully repel others. Watch replays in miniature from your Stronghold, then strategically place and upgrade more structures, champions, and minions to keep future attackers at bay.\n\nFeatures:\n● Kill it your way: 1st-person combat with a variety of weapons and minions who can serve as both allies and enemies\n● Asynchronous Multiplayer: Attack player-created realms, and get attack notifications each time you launch the game\n● Realm Building: Snap together realm Fragments and strategically set up your defences\n● Raid Replay: Watch tabletop replays of attacks on your realm by other players \n● Death from Above: Hop out to god-scale and use Ancient Powers to direct the battle from on high",
