        "description": "Calm Place is a virtual space for tranquility, relaxation and guided meditation. A new part of your daily routine!\n\nTake a moment, sit back and get a few minutes for yourself. Decide the time of your session, make a selection from different guided meditations like body relaxation, deep breathing or start a 7-day mindfulness course. \n\nFeaturing a customizable stylized nature environment where one can experience shifts in weather and time of day creating the illusion of being in a living, breathing place. \n\nCalm Place was developed as a joint project between Mimerse, renown VR-therapy developers based in Stockholm, and Sweden’s seconds largest hospital. Currently Calm Place is being tested in a clinical trial, where the experience is provided to psychiatric inpatients who feel the need to calm down, reduce stress or anxiety.\n\nCalm Place will be continuously expanded and improved based on users comment and feedback. More meditations and environments are already planned!",
