Scan the pitch at the right moments, make the correct passing decisions, and react to regular awareness tests, as you work to improve your vision by replicating situations from real games.\n\nWhether you're looking to fit in more training hours from home, stay sharp when injured, or gain an advantage going into your next game, Be Your Best is designed for all players, both professional and amateur.\n\nBe Your Best is a professional training tool and not a game. Improving your performance takes consistent practice and dedication over time.",
