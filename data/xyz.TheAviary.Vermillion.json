        "description": "NEW! Generate a paint-by-numbers template including matching colors on your palette from any image you find in the browser. Painting has never been more accessible!\n\nIt’s time to discover your inner artist! With Vermillion, you get a fully equipped oil painting studio in your home, without any of the mess. Ready for the unrivaled sense of accomplishment of hanging your first painting in your living room? Learn with your favorite YouTube artists using the built-in web browser, generate a paint-by-numbers template from any image, or even better - learn to paint from (new) friends in multiplayer!\n\nUp to four people can paint together in the studio. Share palettes, work together on each others canvases, teach a class, or have an old-fashioned paint night.\n\nYou can put the easel directly in your own room using Mixed Reality, or immerse yourself into one of the studio environments. Once done, mount and frame your paintings in MR or VR, and easily share your masterpieces to your phone as an image. \n\nVermillion features realistic wet-on-wet color mixing, undo, layers, and a wide range of simulated brushes. Developed with the feedback of both traditional and digital artists, you're sure to get the fun of oil painting without any of the frustration. \n\nArtwork in the screenshots by Gladski, Chad Munn and Mistkinya.",
