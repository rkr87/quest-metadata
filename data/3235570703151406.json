        "description": "*NEW UPDATE!* All Jobs + Infinite Overtime now include subtitles and additional language support!   \n\nIn a world where robots have replaced all human jobs, step into the \"Job Simulator\" to learn what it was like 'to job'.    \n\nPlayers can relive the glory days of work by simulating the ins and outs of being a gourmet chef, an office worker, a convenience store clerk, and more.     \n\nKey Jobbing Features:  \n● Throw a stapler at your boss!   \n● Learn to 'job' in four not-so historically accurate representations of work-life before society was automated by robots!   \n● Use your hands to stack, manipulate, throw, and smash physics objects in an inexplicably satisfying way!   \n● Aggressively chug coffee and eat questionable food from the trash!   \n● Gain valuable life experience by firing new employees, serving slushy treats, brewing English tea, and ripping apart car engines! \n● Work the never-ending night shift with Infinite Overtime mode!",
