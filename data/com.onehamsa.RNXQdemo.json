        "description": "Racket: Nx is a new kind of game that challenges the limits of what you can do with a racket and ball in VR. \n\nThe game features:\n- 2 single player modes - a campaign and an endless runner!\n- Versus & Co-op multiplayer supporting cross platform and multiple devices with the same user!\n- A sick original soundtrack and the option to play your own music in game!\n\nThe game is played inside a giant glass dome, the walls of which light up with targets you must destroy with the ball.\n\nBut this is no ordinary ball!\n\nHit it with force and it will slam into the wall, rolling across it and bulldozing everything in its path!\n\nUse your racket's tractor beam to pull it back, or simply to line up your next shot exactly where you want it. \n\nBe quick and plan your shots well. Learn to control the ball to perfection.",
