        "description": "Butterfly, backstroke, or freestyle! Swim around just like a real turtle, no buttons or joysticks required! Play on your own or join your fellow turtles in a public or private game. Enjoy anything from showing off your tricks on the diving board to exploring hidden treasures!\n\nThere are currently three unique game modes:\n\nTurtle Ball: An underwater game of two-team dodgeball. Hit turtles on the other team to switch them to your own team. Last team standing wins!\n\nZones: A game where turtles race to randomly safe zones that spawn randomly around the ocean. Anyone too slow will be frozen and can slow down unfrozen turtles.\n\nCasual: Hang out with other turtles with no rules!",
