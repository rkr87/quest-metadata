        "description": "Cosmogonic is a 10 minute interactive science fiction animated short.\n\nThis story is told by Cosmogonic—a once-great robot-engineer, who created the universe. When we put on our VR headsets, we step into Cosmogonic’s head and hear him narrate the story of one of the planets he created: Actinuria. Here, the Pallatinids, a society of giant robots, live under the cruel King Archithorius. Fearing a conspiracy, he forces the citizens to wear suits of uranium armor, which causes an explosion if too many of them gather. But one Pallatinid—a bold, young inventor named Pyron—decides to use science and technology to inspire a revolution. \n\nA note from Director Pawel Szarzyński:\n\"Cosmogonic is the story of an oppressed society and its path to liberation. I believe strongly that the basic drive to freedom is universal. Through a sci-fi perspective and a journey to distant, bizarre, and often incomprehensible places, I want to remove our everyday, structured vision of the world, and draw us away from the friendly, earthly environment we know all too well. By creating Cosmogonic’s uncanny world—diving into the origin of its universe, exploring the beginnings of life there, and experiencing the struggles of a developed civilization—I hope to offer a fresh perspective, one that will help us to look clearly at ourselves. Ultimately, the story is a fairy tale. In my opinion, it is one that asks us to face the driving forces of nature, politics, and technology that shape our world today.\"",
