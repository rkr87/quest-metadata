        "description": "Network Collapse is a STEM education game for grade 6-12 students to interactively learn about how information is transmitted and protected on networks.  Players assume the role of a router and must transfer incoming data packets to the correct outgoing pathway without losing too many.  Eventually the player must also recognize a cyber-attack and turn on the best tool to protect their network.  Six levels introduce core basic ideas with increasing complexity in game play to maintain engagement while learning new ideas.",
