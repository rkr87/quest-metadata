The devastating invasive species almost destroyed all of the original inhabitants on the small planet. Facing the danger of imminent extinction, Surviving creatures worked together and managed to tame some of the Gubbies from their hatchlings. As their master, your mission is to train them in the Arena while they fight with other kinds of Gubbies.
