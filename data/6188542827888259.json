        "description": "Developed by SQLearn in partnership with SINTEF Digital, Ready2Respond XR app aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the maritime sector. XR gives an opportunity for a different, innovative educational tool that can be easily adopted and used by the students of naval schools in Greece and Norway.  The training aim is to target aspects that they haven’t been taught during their mandatory public education.  One of the key features of Ready2Respond is its gamified approach to learning. By turning maritime training into an interactive game, students are motivated to actively participate and learn through exploration and experimentation. This gamification enhances engagement and retention, ensuring that students are better prepared to respond to real-world challenges onboard vessels. The Ready2Respond XR simulation consists of four scenarios, each focusing on a different aspect of maritime operations:\n\n    1. Shipboard Incineration\n    2. Crane Operation\n    3. Use of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED)\n    4. Free-fall Lifeboat Launching Procedure\n\nReady2Respond is supported by Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the EEA and Norway Grants in the frame of the Programme “Business Innovation Greece”.",
