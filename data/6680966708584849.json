        "description": "Industrial companies of all sizes—from specialized manufacturers to multinational corporations—are looking to metaverse technologies to improve operating efficiencies, increase employee retention, and modernize the way they onboard, train, and engage their frontline workers. \n\nAltoura helps companies transform their frontline worker training programs from instructor-led, classroom-based training to immersive, virtual training in real-time 3D environments. \n\nTraining creators can easily import 3D models of their buildings, machines, and equipment into Altoura’s immersive virtual environment and build powerful simulations that enable frontline workers to interact and train with those 3D assets from any location, using any device. This way they can become skilled in completing standard operating procedures, standard maintenance procedures, and safety and compliance best practices—all before stepping on the production floor.\n\nThis immersive approach to training enables industrial companies to improve productivity of workers and equipment because they don’t have to take them offline for training; to improve safety and compliance by training workers in a simulated, no-risk environment; at the same time, to reduce training time, cut production errors, and eliminate the need to dedicate capital equipment for training purposes. \n\nAltoura is the only enterprise-grade immersive training platform for the industrial metaverse. \nWith a secure enterprise infrastructure, no-code Experience B",
