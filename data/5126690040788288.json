        "description": "Dive into the world of emergency management in avalanche accidents with this exciting training simulator.\n\nMountain tours with skis, snowboards, or snowshoes are becoming increasingly popular as a winter sport. In the unsecured natural environment, when a winter sports enthusiast is buried by an avalanche, the greatest hope for survival lies in the hands of their companions—a dramatic race against time.\n\nLack of proficiency in handling emergency equipment such as avalanche victim search device (Beacon), shovel, and probe, combined with an unclear action plan, significantly diminishes the chances of survival for the buried individuals. This is where the Emergency Avalanche VR tool comes into play.\n\nFor those who haven't been familiarized with avalanche scenarios through consistent training and haven't internalized these life-saving measures, their ability to act swiftly and effectively in a crisis is compromised.\nAvalanche Emergency VR aims to provide a simple and seamless way for users to experience, practice, and internalize these vital procedures in an immersive environment. Throughout the various search phases, all essential rescue tools – like the Beacon, probe, and shovel – must be employed correctly. In randomized burial scenarios, users can make mistakes, learn from them, or identify areas for improvement with the help of NPCs (non-playable characters) to enhance their rescue skills. In the world of avalanche rescue, every second counts: Time is Life!",
