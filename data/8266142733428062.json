        "description": "# Interactive Physics Playground\nHop into a world where everyone and everything follows the laws of physics. Handle an array of guns with realistic operations and melee weapons ranging from swords to frying pans. Work together to move massive objects, lift others to get to unreachable areas, or give them a high-five for a game well played. With a fully physicalized body, everything is at your disposal for endless fun!\n# Tools for Tinkering\nUtilize the Sandbox Gun - a powerful multitool - to spawn in objects and attach anything together with welds or dynamic joints. Wield this power to build battle arenas, design challenging parkour courses, or just hang out with friends while putting together new gizmos and gadgets.\n# Games Ã€ La Mode\nFrom the open-ended sandbox, to Capture the Flag where you build forts to defend from the enemy team, and NervBall, a brawly, in-your-face test of skill, gamemodes give rules to your world. Host or join a lobby with up to 8 players, public or private.\n# Dynamic Environments\nHop into different maps, including a close-quarters warehouse, an open park set in an expansive city, and a minimalist empty space for unlimited creativity. Use them as inspiration for your creative builds, or as a backdrop for a friendly skirmish.\n# Community-Driven Development\nJoin our active Discord community! Share your ideas, report bugs, and help shape the future of NervBox. With upcoming mod support, you'll be able to upload your own new toys and share them with the growing community.",
