        "description": "Take control of the Floating GunShip and dominate the battlefield in an adrenaline-fueled VR experience, where every shot counts and triumph awaits! Rain unstoppable destruction upon your enemies with the HE 105mm rounds, or obliterate them with armor-piercing penetrators for that satisfying 'one hit cook'! The versatile 40mm provides a rapid response for wiping out any opposition that remains!\n\nTiming is everything - plan your attacks meticulously to evade incoming missiles. Deploy flares at just the right moment to outsmart your enemies. But beware, ammunition is limited, including your life-saving flares!\n\nDesigned for seated play, providing an immersive and intense gameplay. Settle into a chair with armrests, look straight ahead, tilt your head slightly up, and press and hold the re-center button to align yourself to the console. Get ready to be transported to the heart of the action!\n\nThis is an active development project that intends to be as fun as possible; all by a solo developer, me! Witness the game's progress over time as more features, including the powerful 25MM, new operations, and TV guided missiles are added.\n\nJoin the Discord community for updates and voting on future features! Currently exclusive to those who have purchased the game. Likely to change in the near future.\n\nNote: While optimized for Quest 2, FG delivers a satisfying experience on Quest 1 as well. Feedback helps us enhance gameplay for all.\n\nEmbrace the sky-bound chaos - Secure your copy today!",
