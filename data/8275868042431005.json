        "description": "Shoulder pain, stiffness, or weakness? You're not alone! One out of three people will develop shoulder strength or mobility issues in their lifetime. If you’re one of them, you know how profoundly shoulder problems can impact your everyday activities. \n\nMovement exercises done regularly can increase a shoulder's range of motion and strength. Reach is on a mission to create VR experiences that identify your shoulder limitations and recruit movement specific to your strengths and weaknesses, all within immersive VR environments like a quiet, starry evening or a fast-paced galactic battle!\n\nReach’s Beta release includes a Firefly Assessment experience and two games. Each of these experiences tracks your motion progress and provides useful analysis to you in a web-based portal. And, don't forget to check back soon-- more Reach VR experiences are in development!\n\nGive Reach a try, and play your way to better shoulder health-- virtually!",
