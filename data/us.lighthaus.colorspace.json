        "description": "Coloring books are a timeless, easy way for adults and kids to have fun making art. But what if you could step into the coloring book? In Color Space you don’t just color in a scene — you color *inside* a scene.\nEquipped with a palette and a coloring wand, you’re transported into any of 32 beautiful black-and-white worlds created by a growing group of VR's most talented artists. You fill in the world with as many colors as you like, one tree, rock and flower at a time.  \nAs you color, the scene comes to life around you. Rivers run, birds fly, planets revolve, meteors shine. The soundscape responds hypnotically as you color, with custom sound and music created by our incredible musicians and sound designers.",
