Animals and plants can be spawned randomly, or select animals to copy or enlarge in 3 bonus levels.\n\nAnimals include: lions, tigers, bears, dinosaurs, wolves, elephants, rhinos, crocodiles, chickens, sharks, octopus, whales, dolphins, horses, cats, dogs, star fish, leopards, cuttle fish, zebras, owls, seals, lion fish, lizards, goats, sun fish, and many more.",
