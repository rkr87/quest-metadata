During the game, you will experience three Falling Spells events. Each event drops eight spells from the sky. Your pre-selected spells will appear during the first and second events, highlighted with a golden edge for easy identification. You can acquire these spells by attacking them. If you choose not to attack, and your pre-selected rune is not destroyed by other players, it will automatically become yours at the end of the Falling Spells phase. If all runes are destroyed, you will miss out on acquiring additional spells for that event.\n\nVoice Communication Optimization:\nStabilized Voice Communication: We have enhanced the stability of in-game voice communications.\nFixed Voice Bug: Resolved an issue where voice communication would sometimes repeat a phrase repeatedly.\n\nBug Fixes:\nTraining Ground Bugs: Addressed a series of lingering bugs in the training area.\nWar Hut Damage Bug: Fixed a bug where the War Hut could occasionally become immune to damage.\nSky Skill Effects Bug: Corrected a bug where skill effects would incorrectly appear in the sky.\n"
