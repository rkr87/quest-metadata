        "description": "Enter the whimsical wooden world of Loco Dojo & step up to Grand Sensei’s ‘Table of Trials’ to pit your silliest skills against (up to) 3 friends or strangers in this hilariously competitive multiplayer party game\n\nTake turns to spin the wheel & move your counter around the dojo’s game board, acquiring strategic prizes & launching ludicrous trials in which to compete with your rival players to prove yourself as a master of martial madness!\n\nDiscover a wealth of wacky inputs woven through sixteen ridiculous minigames. Perform well & win a pile of Golden Suns to please Grand Sensei, earning the right to enter his temple where victory can be claimed in an asymmetric showdown of epic absurdity\n\nNo friends? No problem! Grand Sensei’s Ten Trial Test provides a highly replayable mode that’s different every time.. Do you have what it takes to obtain the fabled Black Headband & a golden VIP mask? Or hone your skills in the Solo Dojo to unlock more masks!\n\n*NB Internet required for multiplayer",
