        "description": "This is not the classic game. New way to play. \n\nWith Shoottris you will enjoy a new gaming experience in an environment with 3D graphics and spectacular music. We have gone beyond the classic block game, and the result is wonderful.\n\nIncredible game in which you will have to change the way you think because the pieces do not rotate. Why are they going to rotate if you can shape them as you want with your ray?\n\nShoot the ray to break the blocks and give the pieces the shape that suits you.\n\nCare, every piece has a limit of bricks you can break to sculpt it.\n\nTwo game modes:\n\n- Levels: 32 levels await you. Do you think you can overcome them all? In the last levels the puzzle is very difficult\n\n- Endless mode: How long and how many lines can you get? The difficulty increases with time.",
