        "description": "Resolve allows teams building complex construction projects to review large building information model (BIM) projects on the Meta Quest in a collaborative environment. Resolveâ€™s ability to handle the biggest 3D models enables teams to simulate maintenance, safety and accessibility issues earlier than ever before and without hassle. From cutting edge biopharma facilities to wind farms and data centers, Resolve delivers unparalleled performance on wireless VR headsets without the need to section models, stream, or use a hefty PC.\n\nResolve provides teams with a suite of powerful tools including logging issues via speech-to-text, measuring, inspecting BIM properties, viewing 2D plans, review scheduling, issue status and tagging, analytics, AR and more. \n\nResolve requires an Autodesk Construction Cloud account to bring model data into VR and sync issues. Resolve can be used to review Revit, Navisworks, and 70 other file formats supported by BIM 360 Docs.",
