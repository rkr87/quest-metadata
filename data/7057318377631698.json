        "description": "Virtual Courtroom is designed to offer an exact replica of a courtroom for educational purposes in the context of learning about courtroom environment, etiquettes and protocols.\n\nIn many cases, law students do not get sufficient exposure to the courtroom throughout their academic training because the courtrooms are not generally accessible due to the limited space and time.\nInstructors in the school of Law face challenges to explain the detailed, \"how-to\" in the courtroom for their students.\nIn order to solve this instructional challenge, we collaborated with a law professor at the University of San Francisco and designed a Virtual Courtroom which is an exact replica of the district courtroom in the State of California.\n\nInstructors can create  unique sessions and invite only the specific group of students to hold class sessions right inside the Virtual Courtroom. \n\nStudents can also hold unique sessions on their own to meet up within a small group to practice the legal argument. \n\nThis is not a game but a space for professional training and meetings. There are no extraneous characters or animations, only the exact courtroom where the instructors and students can bring their teaching and learning anytime, anywhere it is convenient for them.\n\nAt NID, it is our mission to empower education with virtual reality technology focusing on the essential functionalities that can directly fill the gap occurring in reality.\n",
