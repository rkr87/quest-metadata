        "description": "Dreamy sunsets, sandy toes & summer memories.\n\nThere’s something special about living by the sea. Breathing in the fresh salty air, sinking your toes into the sand, dropping a line or diving into the sapphire water - it’s simultaneously invigorating and relaxing. Enjoy an eternal connection to the sea at The Reef and slip into a more natural rhythm of life.\n\nTaking its name from two prominent rocks offshore from Wreck Point, Two Rocks is an idyllic coastal town renowned for its natural beauty, lifestyle activities and country town feel. \n\nDig your toes in the sand and watch the sun melt into the sea. Let the kids run free in The Reef’s established parks. Drop a line at the Two Rocks Marina. Surf the local break, dubbed ‘The Spot’. Launch at the boat ramp and head for the horizon. Or simply pop into town and enjoy lunch with a view.\n\nA lifetime of moments and memories await at The Reef.\n\n--Focus on the icons to navigate, use the back button on your headset to return to the map.--\n",
