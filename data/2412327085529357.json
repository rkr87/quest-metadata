Sweetens Cove, a masterpiece crafted by visionary designers Rob Collins and Tad King, epitomizes the essence of modern golf. Nestled in the foothills of Appalachia, just 30 minutes from Chattanooga, Tennessee, its unique nine-hole, 18-pin routing ensures endless variety and challenge for each hole. There‚Äôs no lavish clubhouse or driving range‚Äîjust a trailer, a few carts, and a playground for golfers to unleash their imagination and creativity.\n\nQuality Updates and Bug Fixes:\n- Closest To The Pin - Entering this mode from another mode would show your previous lie in the course screen.\n- Tournaments - Leaving a tournament round on Hole 1 would not offer you a resume tournament and result in a DNF.\n- If you did not update the app to the latest version, trying to start a Tournament Round or Challenge on a newly released course would cause a soft crash. Now you will not be allowed to start and will be prompted to update the app. \n- Fixed the G+ Credit balance from showing too many decimal places in your Profile.\n- Updated Quickplay to remember the Green Speed from your last played session.\n- Holding side trigger or raising the club to see the UI above the hole, will now show 'Wrong Pin' on courses with greens that have 2 holes.\n- Giant Mode positioning updates.\n\nCourse Updates: Spyglass\n- Tee Markers now have collision.\n- Hole 9: Aligned a tree model to not interfere with tee shots.\n- Hole 14: Adjusted the OB on the left side of the fairway.\n- Hole 16: Fixed a stake that was floating on the left side of green."

The first five holes play along the coastal dunes, offering breathtaking Pacific Ocean views, before transitioning into the serene and challenging Del Monte Forest. Known affectionately as \"Spy,\" this course co-hosts the prestigious AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on the PGA TOUR.\n\nBug Fixes & Quality Updates:\n\n- The course settings 'holes selection' would not reset to 'Full 18' after playing Butler Pitch and Putt.\n- A specific UX flow would prevent players from entering Butler Pitch and Putt in Quick Play mode.\n- A navigation issue in Challenges where the top menu bar back arrow wouldn't appear after going to another mode.\n- In Clubhouse practice mode, when tapping 'new ball', the new ball was not lined up towards the hole.\n- Updated green fringe physics."

Just a quick 10 minute drive from our headquarters, with holes ranging from 60 to 105 yards, Butler operates on a first-come, first-play basis‚Äîno tee times, just drop a ball into the chute to claim your spot. Home of the Tito's Shorties Classic and supporting partner of Save Muny and Youth On Course, Butler Pitch and Putt truly embodies the spirit of making golf accessible and enjoyable for all.\n\nButler is an example of golf at its best: it's fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it is welcoming to everyone. We've enjoyed rounds at Butler with first time golfers & seasoned vets, humans & dogs, and people wearing golf shoes, flip-flops & cowboy boots. We‚Äôre excited that Butler stands shoulder-to-shoulder with many of the world‚Äôs best courses in GOLF+.\n\nPlease explore this playground of a course, and keep an eye out for all the small details scattered about. The scoreboard behind the putting green for Aces and Low Round is always live, so be sure to dial in your pitch game!"
