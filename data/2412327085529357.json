Led by Andrew Green - coined as ‚Äúgolf‚Äôs new hottest architect‚Äù by Golf Digest - the project began immediately following the 2023 TOUR Championship with the goal of restoring the iconic property to its early 20th century roots. The most notable changes to the course are reflected in the topography, greens and bunkers to allow the course to play both firmer and faster. Streams and ponds were also a primary focus to bring back the native habitat and have water play as a more punishing hazard.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: Purchasing the post renovation East Lake Golf Club will also grant the pre-renovated East Lake for free. If you already own the original East Lake, you will automatically receive the post renovated East Lake for free. In game, the new version will be 'East Lake Golf Club' and the pre-renovated version will be 'East Lake 2023'.\n\nCourse Updates:\nCliffs - Cleaned up some 'triangles' on the course that would show on the Map interface\nCastle Pines - Cleaned up some lines within the skybox and fixed a seam between fairway and rough on Hole 13"

There‚Äôs no lavish clubhouse or driving range‚Äîjust a trailer, a few carts, and a playground for golfers to unleash their imagination and creativity.\n\nQuality Updates and Bug Fixes:\n- Closest To The Pin - Entering this mode from another mode would show your previous lie in the course screen.\n- Tournaments - Leaving a tournament round on Hole 1 would not offer you a resume tournament and result in a DNF.\n- If you did not update the app to the latest version, trying to start a Tournament Round or Challenge on a newly released course would cause a soft crash. Now you will not be allowed to start and will be prompted to update the app. \n- Fixed the G+ Credit balance from showing too many decimal places in your Profile.\n- Updated Quickplay to remember the Green Speed from your last played session.\n- Holding side trigger or raising the club to see the UI above the hole, will now show 'Wrong Pin' on courses with greens that have 2 holes.\n- Giant Mode positioning updates.\n\nCourse Updates: Spyglass\n- Tee Markers now have collision.\n- Hole 9: Aligned a tree model to not interfere with tee shots.\n- Hole 14: Adjusted the OB on the left side of the fairway.\n- Hole 16: Fixed a stake that was floating on the left side of green."
