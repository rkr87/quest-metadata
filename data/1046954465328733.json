The player interacts with spiders by completing novel tasks, collecting points and beating boss stages whilst getting dynamic coaching from a virtual therapist. Starting with a cartoony spider, intensity gradually increases with game progression. \n\nItsy was developed in cooperation with world leading researchers at Stockholm University.",
