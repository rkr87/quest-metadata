        "description": "VRFS is a community-driven soccer (football) simulator with focus on realistic physics and competitive multiplayer.\n\nHere are the main features of VRFS:\n\nPHYSICS SIMULATION: Players can perform almost any trick, from balancing the ball on the tip of their foot to executing curved power shots and long passes. The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine.\n\nCOMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for instantaneous ball-touch response. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real soccer. \n\nCOMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required.\n\nNO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.\n\nFREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project.\n\nPlease keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.\n",

Host solo practice, online practice, or private lobbies on custom arenas. Share arena codes. Build simultaneously on the same scene by sharing a private code with collaborators. This mode will improve based on your feedback.\n\n[ Physics Engine Update ]\nSignificantly enhanced ball control, short passing, and power shots. Mechanics remain unchanged, but accuracy in low and high power impacts has improved drastically.  Introduced new head physics for performing headers (not easily though).\n\n[ Stadium Upgrade and Locker Rooms ]\nThe enlarged stadium now supports 8v8 games with the largest pitch. Players in private and practice games can gather in locker rooms and exit through the gate. Locker rooms are currently non-interactive but will be updated based on feedback.\n\n[ Major Bots Update ]\nImproved logic and lifelike animations for in-field bots. The botkeeper in solo practice can switch to the main goal. You can play matches with bots with any of your balls (but don’t expect them to handle the rugby ball correctly, we haven’t even tried). Bots are still under active development.\n\n[ Anti \"Height Glitching\" ]\nSprinting capacity now adjusts based on in-game leg length, rendering “height glitching” useless. \n\n[ Sound FX ]\nSound effect updates include air flows and ball sounds. A new FX system aiming for real-life sound accuracy is in development, in partnership with a renowned sound design studio.\n\n[ Private Lobbies Update ]\nLobby creators can now adjust after-goal time, pause/start, and restart games. Introduced a new ruleset 'Light rules + Offsides' for private lobbies.\n\n[ Penalty Series ]\nPenalty series now use identical goals for both teams, aiming for bug-free gameplay. Rapid bug fixes promised.\n\n[ Scenes Updates ]\nNew larger goals in some stadiums and minor enhancements, including new ads.\n\n[ In-Game Interface ]\n1v1 and ranked games feature a new GUI, displaying player names and ELOs.\n\n[ New Settings ]\nYou can now set up to 100 balls in solo practice and choose the ‘random ball’ option.  Choose between match rating and score display. New volume setting for voice chat and an option to hide player names above avatars.\n\n[ VRFS Camera App ]\nCustomize overlay designs like score, timers, and team names. Enhanced player movement smoothness. MacOS and Quest versions coming soon.\n\n[ Bugfix ]\nWe've worked hard to ensure stability and had to rebuild the whole thing. The ball may still get out of sync occasionally, but various bugs related to rules detection, goal tracking, penalties, gloves exploits, and offsides bugs are hopefully fixed forever. A lot has been done to increase stability for players with poor internet connection. \n\n[ Optimizations ]\nSmoother multiplayer gameplay with reduced frame drops. Faster custom jersey loading with additional regional servers.\n\n[ Minor Enhancements ]\nImproved ball lighting, avatar materials, and various small game elements.\n\n[ New Ball Forms ]\nNew ball types, including mini, rugby, and tennis balls, available in the store following the physics update.\n\n[ Juggling Counter ]\nA counter appears during solo practice juggling.\n\n[ Increased Mod Team ]\nWe thank everyone who contributes to improving our community by making reports. We are actively working on moderation, including AI tools, so your reports are valuable even if offending players are not immediately banned."
