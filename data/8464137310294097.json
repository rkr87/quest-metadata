        "description": "VRFS is a community-driven soccer (football) simulator with focus on realistic physics and competitive multiplayer.\n\nHere are the main features of VRFS:\n\nPHYSICS SIMULATION: Players can perform almost any trick, from balancing the ball on the tip of their foot to executing curved power shots and long passes. The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine.\n\nCOMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for instantaneous ball-touch response. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real soccer. \n\nCOMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required.\n\nNO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.\n\nFREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project.\n\nPlease keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.\n",

Replays are currently in beta, with features like auto-saving goals, sharing replays, and stadium screen replays coming soon.\n\nMEET THE NEW BRAND “U19”:\nU19 designers are creating extra detailed cosmetics with unique, slightly futuristic concepts. The brand is launching with a limited offer of three bundles, each consisting of six items. All items are also available for single purchase.\n\nOTHER ENHANCEMENTS:\n- Fixed minor bugs, such as players sometimes appearing in a white t-shirt.\n- Potentially removed lag when other players were switching between custom jerseys or entering the lobby. \n- Fixed the ball rotation sync (previously appeared to rotate slower when kicked by other players). \n- Fixed the ball slightly teleporting when entering the goals.\n- Fixed lag when scrolling through custom arena lists.\n\n\nThank you all for playing VRFS.
