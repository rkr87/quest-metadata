        "description": "VRFS is a community-driven soccer (football) simulator with focus on realistic physics and competitive multiplayer.\n\nHere are the main features of VRFS:\n\nPHYSICS SIMULATION: Players can perform almost any trick, from balancing the ball on the tip of their foot to executing curved power shots and long passes. The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine.\n\nCOMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for instantaneous ball-touch response. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real soccer. \n\nCOMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required.\n\nNO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.\n\nFREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project.\n\nPlease keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.\n",

                "change_log": "UPDATE 0.3.7\n\n**Multiplayer:**\n- Updated multiplayer sync to decrease lag time and address issues like ‘phasing’. This should also help with the problem of deflected balls appearing as goals, but we are still working on more complex enhancements. This feature is experimental and we appreciate your feedback.\n- You can now use gloves after the goal is scored (this was highly requested).\n\n**Scenes:**\n- Added an enlarged version of the starting stadium with access to the stands and locker rooms.\n\n**Camera mode:**\n- Press grip to speed up (two grips to speed up faster).\n- Press triggers to go up/down.\n- Use camera mode in online public practice lobbies and in arena editing.\n\n**Arena editor:**\n- Added snap to grid feature.\n- Place texts with adjustable size and color (up to 1,000 chars per instance).\n- Most of the objects now have a ‘scale’ setting, thus allowing for resizing.\n- Switch to camera mode when in the arena editor.\n\n**Replays:**\n- Share replay codes (and watch replays in the camera apps a bit later).\n- Rewind / Fast-forward replays by pressing (A) and (X) on controllers.\n- Slow-motion feature (press (A) + (X) on controllers).\n- Increased smoothness of moving objects.\n\n**Other:**\n- Interface enhancements.\n- Various fixes and optimizations in the in-game menu.\n- Slightly improved sound effects.\n- Some bugs were fixed \n\n**In-game store:**\n- U19 Launch Bundle items removed from the store.\n- New ‘Fun Kit’ bundle added, containing 12 items such as a golf ball, hockey puck, fitness ball, and more.\n\nAnnouncement\nAlthough the bundle is called 'Fun Kit,' its purpose goes beyond fun. It's part of our research, and the physics and features of these objects will evolve in the coming weeks.\n"
