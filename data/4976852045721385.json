Paddle, get fit, discover new islands and hidden treasure, or just relax and hang out with friends (online multiplayer).\n\nOn 'SUP Island' (SUP = Stand Up Paddleboard) you stand on a big surfboard and use a long paddle to move yourself over the water.  It's the perfect sport for virtual reality as you and your board move naturally through the world, just like in real-life.\n\nRelaxation or fitness? You choose. Paddle around and explore your surroundings, and before you know it you'll have achieved your fitness goals and be finding treasure and earning rewards like new boards, paddles and locations. Fitness tracking is built-in so you can see your real-time stats like time paddled, distance, and estimated calories burnt.\n\nEverything's better with friends so start a party in your headset and invite your VR friends to hang out on your own private island.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?
