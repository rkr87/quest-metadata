Popping them will deduct 2 seconds from your time. ‚è±Ô∏è\n- Improved the bullets charging mechanic during Run phases. Your hands now get all shiny when fully charged ! ‚ú®\n- You can now destroy the \"big bad bullets\" from those big robots by shooting 10 bullets at them.\n- The exercise instructions will appear slowly only when you come across them for the first time."
