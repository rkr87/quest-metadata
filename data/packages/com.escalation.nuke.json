        "description": "Please, Don’t Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking button-pushing simulation.\n\nCovering for a colleague who is taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious panel which only component is a red button. And since you’ve clearly been instructed not to touch anything, the only thing you want to do now is push that damn button. \n\nPush it and expect to be held liable for any unintended aftermath. And there will be many.\n\nScavenge the room for clues, tools and buttons to solve riddles and trigger wicked events rich with clever cultural references. You cannot begin to imagine how many mind blowing surprises such a deceptively simple console has for you.\n\n5 new puzzles have been created exclusively for this Oculus version. Players who already beat the original Please, Don't Touch Anything will be thrilled to discover overhauled versions of the already existing endings, which feature new ways to be solved as well as new endings tailored for VR.",
