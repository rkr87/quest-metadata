        "description": "TOTALLY BASEBALL has just received a HUGE update! Get your gloves ready, because SPECIAL PITCHES and PRO BATTING are officially here! Along with the standard pitch you're used to, you can now throw:\n\n- Slowballs\n- Fastballs\n- Curveballs\n- Splitters\n\nIn order to change or select special pitches, just shake your head side to side or up and down! (Just like a real Pitcher!) Along with these new pitches, we've added an entirely new batting mode to add more challenge for those who want it! You can still use the classic batting mode you're familiar with, or you can try out our PRO batting for a completely new hitting experience! Adjust the difficulty in your settings to set your perfect \"sweet spot\" on the bat, and see how good it feels when you hit the ball JUST right!\n\nNeed to practice? No biggie. Both of these new features are in the tutorial, so give them a shot on your own before you try them against friends.\n\nWe've also expanded our locker room in Free Roam to more comfortably accommodate up to 20 players--and added a visible \"ready up\" and \"player assist\" menu screen so that you can see who is and is not ready, and what batting/throwing assist levels your teammates are set to!\n\nMascots have also made an entrance... Now, during certain game events, these lovable characters will cheer you on and hype you up!\n\nPlay TOTALLY BASEBALL now to enjoy these exciting updates (and a few others, like new running animations, smarter AI players, an updated tutorial field, and more!)
