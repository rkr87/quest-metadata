        "description": "In the Cloud VR Afterlife begins with Theo James (Tomiwa Edun), the genius inventor behind Cloud Inc., as he welcomes you to the Cloud and walks you through the technology that allows him to map the human brain. After introducing the Cloud, James will begin to ask you a series of questions to dig deep into your soul and better understand your morality. With every answer, a slim crack widens encompassing a visually stimulating journey to the other side to reveal your inner truth that may or may not be what it seems. The VR experience, based off of the Crackle Original Movie, In the Cloud, is a spectacular and mystical ride built with live-action actors, visually stunning special effects and 360-sound.",
