        "description": "THE WORLD OF ALTAIR\nSet on the floating island of Vastus Isle, once a magic workshop now in ruins and exploited to run AI experiments. Take on battles to push back the army of LAWS (Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems) that are roaming around and help Stella, the humanoid AI left in charge of ALTAIR, to maintain peace.\n\nBATTLE SYSTEM\nMove from map to map while enjoying the feeling of transcendent sword fighting.\nTake advantage of your surroundings by climbing and gliding to easily take on enemies. \nExperience a wide range of attacks only possible in the VR world, like Shockwaves and Surge Mode.\n\nUSER-FRIENDLY UI\nA simplified and intuitive UI was developed to increase the sense of VR and not interrupt the game flow.\nThe Tablet will be your main hub to change equipment, check your status and more.\n\nCO-OP MULTIPLAYER\nTeam up with other 3 players from around the world and take on enemies together.\nThe game supports crossplay between Quest 2 and PCVR and features a native voice chat system.",
