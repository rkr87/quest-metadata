        "description": "\"Weaving a Better Future\" is a virtual reality (VR) experience developed by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) to accompany the exhibition Empowering Women: Artisan Cooperatives that Transform Communities. Through this 360-degree visual experience, viewers are virtually transported to Guatemala, where they explore the world of artisan women working for empowerment and asserting their rights. The video was created by CMHR staff members, who visited the villages, workplaces and homes of Maya women in weaving communities. These women use cooperative work and traditional weaving to make a living, preserve their culture and heal from human rights violations. \n\nThis experience is designed to be viewed with Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR and other virtual reality phone mounts. Place the phone in the viewer upon launch of the app. Headphones are recommended. You can also view the video without a VR viewer simply by moving your smartphone.",
