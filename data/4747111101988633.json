VFC is more brutal, more free-formed, and hopefully, less serious.\n\nWith PVP at its core, VFC seeks to explore into a realm of possibility enabled by VR's unshackling of real-life restraints, and it strives to become the 'Street Fighter' in VR. We've implemented so many fighting mechanics that can't be comprehended in a simple article. Please visit vfcgame.com for details.\n\nIf sparring while chatting with your opponent isn't your thing, VFC also has a lighthearted single-player campaign. Our AI is tactful and fights with diverse styles. \n\nPlayers can choose to queue into a PvP game while playing offline modes.\n\nOutside of 1v1 fighting, VFC boasts a wide range of fitness training modes that let player practice their striking, endurance, stamina, defense awareness and combat readiness; it even hosts a running competition inside the game!",
