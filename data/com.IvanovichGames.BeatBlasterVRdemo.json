        "description": "Beat Blaster is a VR game of shooting, running, and dodging where everything happens to the music rhythm. An original mix of styles where each game will offer you a new challenge.\n\n30 SONGS & AMBISONIC AUDIO\nEach level introduces a novelty, and all the games are different thanks to the intelligent generation of levels. \nAmbisonic sound lets you experience the music in an entirely new way.\n\n3 WAYS OF MOVEMENT\nYou can choose between the classic VR controller, tilting the head, or the intuitive and original control based on the head's movement. \n\nNO MOTION SICKNESS\nBeat Blaster is a VR game with a high-speed component. But all the game moves are designed without rotating the player, thus minimizing the probability of motion sickness.\n\nEASY RULES\nTo clear a level, you must reach the end of the song without dying. You have a Blaster with infinite ammunition and single life to dodge or kill all the enemies that will appear to the music's rhythm.",
