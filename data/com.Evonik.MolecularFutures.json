        "description": "Spend a day in five alternative versions of the year 2040. Wake up, go to the bathroom, get to work—and observe how everything around you changes depending on the future you select - from the toothbrush to the energy production. In one future you may be an AI psychologist treating AI assistants, in another an engineer working for a chinese company in a backward Europe or a sustainability manager at the top of her game in a truly sustainable economy. Molecular Futures is a Speculative Design VR Application that is based on actual foresight work by the Specialty Chemicals company Evonik. Peak inside the work of expert futurists and explore the future through their eyes. What implications, opportunities and challenges does it hold?",
