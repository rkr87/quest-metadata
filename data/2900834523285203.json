        "description": "!! Winner of SXSW Best Use of Immersive Arts 2019 !!\n\nNOTE: This is not a game, but a narrative documentary experience.\n\n\"Home After War\" is a room-scale, interactive virtual reality experience that takes you to Fallujah, a city that was, until recently, under Islamic State (IS) control. The war against IS has ended but the city is still unsafe.\n\nThere’s one looming fear for returning refugees – booby trapped homes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the neighbourhoods.\n​\nAhmaied Hamad Khalaf and his family returned home after the fighting subsided.\n\nExplore Ahmaied’s home by either walking physically or teleporting in the space as he tells you his story about returning to a home that might be booby trapped. Witness life outside the four walls of his house through 360° videos embedded in the space.\n​\nHear Ahmaied speak of his loss, and his hopes. Learn what it's like to fear the home you once loved.\n\nWARNING: This experience contains disturbing content. Viewer discretion is advised. It may not be suitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
