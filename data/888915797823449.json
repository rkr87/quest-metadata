        "description": "There is a magical world where games, smiles, and a serene lake beckons.  A place where your robot pal lives.  Where items waiting to be crafted share warm afternoons with friends waiting to be found.  A place once out of reach - but now accessible from anywhere in the world through the dimension-piercing magic of virtual reality.  \n\n\nThis place is called Daydream Blue.\n\n\nThe lake is there, and a raft for you to lie upon.  Your campsite, too. A tent rests just aside the fire under a glowering starlit dusk.  Nearby, your favorite rock and stones perfect for skipping.  Trees high as the heavens.  This is where you can smile, where you can connect with all those other people across the world looking for a little relaxation and lot of fun.\n\n\nMultiplayer?  Yep.  Fishing?  Of course.  UFO invasions?  If you know where to look.  Daydream Blue explores a reality just outside ours. It’s a feeling out there in the space between hassles.  It’s your own place.  Your own dream.",
