For example, searching for \">3\" will match with all tags that have a rating greater than 3.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fixed bluetooth keyboard issues with missing keys like hyphen, comma, and numpad. Most keys should now work, except for the numpad \"+\" and \"*\" keys, which I haven't figured out how to fix yet.\n"

New videos that were loaded with the HereSphere web API were always set to chroma key masking and passthrough background in v0.10.0. This issue is now fixed, but in order to remove the bad video settings that have been already saved, you'll need to go to the media library, and manually delete the website's media source (or remove each individual video's settings from the media library). The hspArray field should also now be parsed correctly, and should be applied to both full videos and trailers for websites using the HereSphere web API."

            {
                "version": "0.10.0",
                "change_log": "HereSphere update v0.10.0 adds support for passthrough with chromakey and alpha masking, as well as some quality of life features.\n\nPassthrough and masking:\n- Added support for passthrough. You can switch to passthrough mode on a global basis (for all videos) by going to the user settings, clicking on the background dropdown box under the environment group, and then select passthrough. If you want to only enable passthrough for the current video, go to the advanced video setting when the video is playing, and then change the background dropdown box under the environment group to passthrough.\n- Added chroma key masking, which removes parts of an image based on the color (useful for removing green screens for passthrough). To enable chroma key masking, go to the advanced video settings, and under the environment group, change the mask dropdown box to chroma key. Press the cogwheel icon next to the dropdown box to edit the chroma key mask settings. You can define up to three different chroma key colors, a light despill color, and a light injection color. Click on the eyedropper icon to select a color by choosing a location in the image. Pixels that are similar in color to the chroma keys will be made transparent. You can define a cutoff value, soften value, exponent, and spill mask for each chroma key to specify the range of affected pixels. Pixels that are close to the light despill color will have their color adjusted to remove the tint of the despill color. This helps with removing green screen halos and skin tinted by the green screen. After the light despill operation, the color may look unnatural, so the light injection can be used to add color back into the image to make it more natural.  For more details, view the tooltips by holding the grip button when hovered over the settings. (Note: for the best performance, leave the exponent settings at 1, and the despill spill mask at 0).\n- Added alpha packed masking, which defines the alpha (opacity) of the image by packing it into another region of the image. To enable alpha packed masking, go to the advanced video settings, and under the environment group, change the mask dropdown box to alpha packed. Press the cogwheel icon next to the dropdown box to edit the alpha packed mask settings. The alpha coordinates shift x and shift y settings define the position of the alpha image relative to the normal colored image. The alpha coordinates scale x and scale y settings define the size of the alpha image relative to the normal colored image. For more details, view the tooltips by holding the grip button when hovered over the settings.\n\nQuality of life improvements:\n- AB Loop times are now saved per video\n- Enabled keyboard and mouse support. Go to the keybindings menu, and then add your keybindings to the keyboard or mouse group (you can also press the load default keybindings button). There are some known issues. When typing in a number box, you will need to press esc first, and then press enter after you're finished typing in a number. The mouse cursor movement doesn't work correctly. I'll try to fix in this in a future update.\n- Added heatmap opacity setting to the synchronized peripherals menu. Lowering the opacity will make the heatmap more transparent, so it's easier to see the current playback position.\n\nHS Web API:\n- Added \"alphaPackedSettings\" and \"chromaKeySettings\" field, which can be used to load settings for alpha/chroma key masks. Check the HereSphere discord for more details on the HereSphere web API.\n- Added \"hspArray\" field, which contains the url of hsp file and the version of the hsp file. Newer hsp files aren't backwards compatible with older HereSphere installations, so the version number is used to determine which hsp file can be read.\n"

                "change_log": "HereSphere update v0.9.8 adds a toggle called \"Network SMB Device Scan\" to the user settings. When enabled (default), this allows scanning of the local network for SMB devices at startup. Disabling this toggle will prevent this scan from happening, which might help with crashes caused by the scan. If you're experiencing crashes after about 10-20 seconds of the app launching, disabling this toggle should prevent the issue. Make sure to disable your headset's wifi before launching the app, disable the Network SMB Device Scan toggle, and then re-enable your headset's wifi."

This update adds support for bluetooth devices, script heatmaps, quality of life improvements, and minor bug fixes.\n\n- Added support for bluetooth synchronized peripherals. In the synchronized peripherals menu (access by clicking on the play button with radio waves above the seekbar), enable the synchronized peripherals toggle, then click on the \"Scan Bluetooth Devices\" button, and then accept the requested permission. The app will scan and connect to supported bluetooth devices.\n- Added script heatmaps, which will be displayed on the seekbar when a script is loaded. Cool colors represent lower speeds, while warm colors represent higher speeds. The vertical area that is colored represents the movement range.\n- Added an \"Auto Collapse Main Menu\" toggle to the user settings under the miscellaneous group. When enabled, the main menu will automatically collapse after clicking on a file to play a video.\n- Added a filename suffix \"_2D\" that will force the player to use flat screen settings (monoscopic and perspective projection).\n- Reduced aspect ratio tolerance for autodetecting video projection format for VR videos.\n- Added \"_F120\" or \"_120F\" filename suffix for fisheye 120 degree linear lens projection.\n- Added an \"Open Random Playlist\" keybinding.\n- Increased http timeout to 90 seconds (from 60 seconds).\n- Added code to better handle serialization changes between different update versions.\n- Fixed issue with file explorer dates displaying time in UTC instead of the local timezone."

                "change_log": "HereSphere update v0.9.6 for the Quest, Quest 2, and Quest Pro is now available. This update adds video buffering settings, fixes playback issues, and adds some quality of life improvements. \n\nVideo buffering:\n- Added player buffer settings to the user settings.\n- Buffer size can be increased to allow reading more data ahead of time for fewer buffering pauses, or reduced to improve latency when seeking. The total memory allocated to all videos is around 300MB, so the real buffer time duration might be less than what you've set, depending on the bitrate of the video, and the number of videos being played.\n- Changed to a better ExoPlayer network stack (Cronet) that is capable of streaming HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 sources.\n- Increased the video timeout to 60 seconds, which should allow videos to eventually load and seek when the network conditions are bad.\n- Added a SMB block size setting, which can be increased to improve SMB throughput or decreased to improve SMB latency. On a side note, if you're hosting SMB shares (especially on MacOS), then turning off packet signing on your SMB host device should improve speeds.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fixed issue with videos sometimes failing to start playing when opened.\n- Fixed issue with the player running out of memory and crashing when using multiscreen mode. The app will now scale the target buffer size based on the number of visible screens. The player should be able to handle over a dozen simultaneous 1080p videos with good performance. For good measure, it's recommended to keep the max buffer size in the user settings fairly low to reduce the chance of running out of memory.\n- Fixed issue with video not closing and freeing up resources when the stop button is pressed twice (last rendered image is still visible, but the video player is actually closed).\n- Fixed issue with keybindings not saving automatically after loading saved backup data.\n- Fixed issue with flat screen videos (perspective projection) not applying image settings correctly when opened.\n- Updated the HereSphere web browser user agent, so the web browser should now work with websites like Spotify, that require newer chromium versions.\n- Video previews in the HereSphere web API view now properly pause when the menu is hidden.\n\nQuality of life improvements:\n- Video no longer pauses when the Oculus menu is opened.\n- Added a \"Toggle Favorite\" keybinding (just before halfway down the keybindings list) that will toggle the current video's favorited state.\n- Added an \"Auto Create HSP\" toggle to the user settings. The \"Auto Update HSP\" toggle has to be enabled for this toggle to be visible. When both toggles are enabled, HSP files will automatically be created and updated.\n- Added a button to write the title of a streamed video (with restricted characters removed) to the script fallback directory. This title can be used to rename your script file so the fallback script will play when streaming a video. The button, which looks like a save icon, can be found in the synchronized peripherals menu next to the fallback script directory input box when playing a streamed video.\n- A notification will now appear if the SMB startup scan is still running in the background when accessing an SMB bookmark\n\nOther changes:\n- Build now targets Android SDK 32 (Android 12). In order for HereSphere to access your non-media files (like video settings, save backup data, and script), you must give HereSphere the permission to manage all your data. A prompt will appear on startup if this permission isn't granted."
