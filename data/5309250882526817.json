        "description": "You are physically the player in one of the first Passthrough FPS games.  Use Quest 3 mesh mapping abilities to turn your playspace into a battlefield faster than ever! Choose a game mode and survive for a given amount of time to unlock new difficulties. Defend your play area in your own home!\n\nFor Quest 2 and Pro headsets:\nThe player must have the correct headset settings and make sure that the headset software is updated to manually draw define the play area and cover.\n\nIf you are having difficulty with the setup or the experience, please join our Discord on the company website and contact us and we will get back to you in the fastest way.\n\nMore content and improvements will be coming in the future to this game!\n\n- If there are tracking and performance issues with your headset and you experience scene shifting or limited visibility, restart your headset and delete guardian history through the settings menu. Redraw your guardian bounds to fill the whole play area.  These issues are from the headset and not the app itself.\n.\nQuest 1 is not supported\n\nIf you enjoyed the app, please leave a review as it really helps!",
