        "description": "In the Eyes of the Animal allows you to explore the forest through the eyes of four woodland species, it is an artistic interpretation of how animals view the world and their living environment.\n\nDeveloped by creative studio Marshmallow Laser Feast - who delight in exploring the line between virtual and real-world experiences. In The Eyes of the Animal was created using UAV’s, lidar scans and bespoke 360° cameras. This has helped shape the point cloud aesthetic and ghostly architecture we view in the computer generated environment. The visual experience is also complimented by a meditative binaural soundscape using audio recordings from forests in the UK.\n\nThis mobile experience brings you on an episodic journey as the story of the animal food chain unfolds over four chapters introducing the species, their visions and their worlds.",
