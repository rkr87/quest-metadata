        "description": "Madrid Noir is a 45 minute, Emmy award winner, mystery adventure that unfolds across two acts in this VR film.\n\nAfter her estranged uncle is declared dead, a disenchanted young woman arrives in Madrid to empty the apartment that he left behind. Lola is soon compelled to dig into her memories, where she'll pick up her uncle's shadowy trail and attempt to piece together the puzzles of the past. Staged as an awe inspiring theatre production, this charming escapade plays out across a city that lives in the night, a Madrid now lost to time.\n\nTake a heavy pinch of classic noir, blend it with a bucket load of gleeful animation and mix it all up with interactivity that invites you to explore and uncover clues from Lola’s past –  and you've got the recipe for a story  you won't soon forget!\n\nDeveloped by No Ghost and Produced by Atlas V, the team that brought you Battlescar and Gloomy Eyes. Madrid Noir premiered at Tribeca Film Festival 2021 and Annecy Film Festival 2021. \n",
