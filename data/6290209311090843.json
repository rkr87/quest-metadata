        "description": "Chrono Weaver is a single-player co-op time-travel puzzle game. Work with copies of yourself as you travel through space and time, finding solutions to seemingly impossible tests. Explore a beautifully crafted mysterious world guided by an unusual flying robot. In this demo play through a full-featured shortened version of the game and experience time-bending fun.\n\nMASTER TIME-TRAVEL TO WORK WITH YOURSELF\nDonâ€™t have friends to play with you? No problem! In Chrono Weaver you use time-travel to solve co-op puzzles by yourself! Use the Origin Point Device to spawn the next version of you and then set off solving one part of the puzzle. Your co-worker, also powered by you, will work at the same time solving a different part. \n\nSOLVE UNIQUE PHYSICS BASED PUZZLES\nUse your wits to discover the puzzling path to the data disk aided by buttons, levers, ropes, bouncers, and more. A whole new dimension opens up when you can be in multiple places at once, and physics is way more fun in VR. Bringing both of these things together creates something you have to experience to understand.\n\nSLINGSHOT YOUR WAY ACROSS A BEAUTIFUL WORLD\nDemonstrate your accuracy and precision with the amazing Quantum Slingshot. Use this slingshot to make impossible shots in a desolate research facility. There are twists and turns all around, and lots to discover in this story rich environment. There are things to throw and cans to crush in our physics based world that takes full advantage of VR.\n",
