        "description": "The multi-awarded narrative VR experience is now available on Oculus Quest. ARTE gives you the opportunity to discover and rediscover Notes On Blindness, an emotional journey into a world beyond sight. \n\nIn 1983, after decades of steady deterioration, John Hull became totally blind. To help him make sense of the upheaval in his life, he began documenting his experiences on audio cassettes. These original diary recordings create the basis of this interactive non-fictional narrative which is a cognitive and emotional experience of blindness. Storytelling, art direction and graphical universe form a unique and singular immersion, completed by movement tracking, spacialized sound and controller interactions. \n\nProduced by Ex Nihilo, Arte France in co-production with Archer’s Mark. Executive Producer, Novelab Audiogaming. Supported by TFI New Media Fund and Ford Foundation – JustFilms, CNC and Région Midi-Pyrénées.",
