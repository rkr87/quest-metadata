Your guns and your wits are all you have left. Fight the deadly enemies, dodge dangerous anomalies, and complete missions on your way to the Radius center to find your way out.\n\n✔Explore the Radius\n\nBe careful: the Radius is swarming with deadly anomalies dealing damage to anyone foolish or daring enough to get close. Navigate with your realistic map, plan your route, scout out shelters, uncover loot caches, and try not to get killed. At least not too often.\n\n✔Collect and fire realistic guns\n\nRealistic interaction with a stunning variety of firearms like AK-74, M4A1, SKS, FN FAL, MP412 REX, Mosin-Nagant, and many more.\n\n✔Survive by all means\n\nNavigate the terrain, move slowly, take cover, sneak, and beware of the threats around you!",
