        "description": "We are a collaboration solution that uses Virtual Reality to allow meetings to happen. \n\nCollaborate effectively with colleagues, partners or customers no matter where they are. Use tools that people know in meeting rooms, whiteboards, post-it notes and presentation slides or documents. You and the other participants modify and discuss in real-time. \n\nImmerse yourself in the meeting,  seeing and hearing everyone using spatial sound. \n\nWhile the experience is best suited a VR headset, you can use any device to join a meeting.\n\nAdditional benefits of a virtual meeting room come into play at the end of the meeting. Firstly the meeting room is persistent, so it is there with all of the notes, discussion and set up exactly as you left it. If you need to go back and continue, you can step straight in.\n\nSecondly, because the meeting room is virtual, have as many places to meet as you like. The possibilities are limitless and require no expensive floor space.",
