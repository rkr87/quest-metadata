Enjoy your new snacking addiction and don’t forget to spit out the shells!\nThe Tide will no longer teleport the player to a random location if they are in a shelter when the Tide occurs.\nThe mission computer now clearly indicates if the player doesn’t have any Top-priority Missions available.

After purchasing this pack, you will receive a camo PM immediately in the player’s hub if you have completed the first tutorial. To apply camo to other weapons, you must have the appropriate firearms, which are available based on your Security Level. You can apply and remove camo on any of the aforementioned guns using the Upgrade Box in the player’s hub if you have them.\n"
