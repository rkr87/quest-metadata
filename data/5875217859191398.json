        "description": "XR-EASY offers a cutting-edge solution for presenting space plans in virtual reality. The solution is designed to be user-friendly and enables you to transform different 3D formats for kitchens, bathrooms, living or dining rooms into a fully immersive virtual experience for your customers. The solution consists of two applications: a VR headset application and a accompanying desktop software. The VR headset application is designed for use with Meta VR headsets and allows clients to experience their dream space in 1:1 scale. The accompanying desktop software is available for Windows and is used to convert 3D models from CAD into the VR format. The software also facilitates VR use, enables online VR sessions, and offers a range of useful functions such as predetermined teleport points.\n\nThe desktop software is available for download at https://xr-easy.com/vr-showroom and a paid CAD-to-VR license is required for converting the 3D models into VR format. However, the desktop software can also be used as a free viewer for additional session participants without a license. XR-EASY also provides a free 14-day trial to test the software's compatibility with your 3D-CAD files.\n\nThere are already several converted demo 3D models available in the desktop software, allowing you to test the VR headset and desktop software. If you have any questions or require support, please visit our knowledge base at https://xr-easy.com/vr-showroom/support/.",
