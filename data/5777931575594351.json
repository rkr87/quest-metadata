        "description": "Time Has Stopped is a single-player vehicular shooter with an automatic time dilation.\n\nDrive through colorful realms, meet the minions and beat their bosses.\nThe game is built for movement and maneuver, but if you're in a bind, just stop and assess.\nThe game will wait for you.\n\nWhile you're a tank, you're not a tank and die from a single penetrating hit.\nDeflect enemy shells by positioning your armor, evade them or destroy them mid-flight.\n\nGood news, most enemies die from a single hit too.\nBad news, they also have armor, so aim carefully over long distances at them... or just spam shells.\n\nTHS doesn't limit you in power, the main gun has infinite shells and is more than enough to complete the whole game.\nBut, of course, there are five interesting sidegrades to switch to when the opportunity arises. And the sixth, forbidden one.\n\nBosses will require a different approach.\nEach shell costs you time and bosses won't give you a lot of leeway.\n\nBut a single-player game is to be enjoyed, not suffered through.\nSo, not only we have difficulty levels, but we also have cheats.\nYou'll have to remember the button combos yourself, though, otherwise it'll be cheating.\n\nOur levels are full of secrets, even the tutorial one.\nAnd many more levels are being polished up to your standards as we speak.\n\nJump in!",
