When paired with the Gear S series, your heart rate can also be measured, providing even more information to gauge your progress.\nFeatures:\n- Headsets and microphone are required for better voice recognition.\n- You can turn on/off Gear S Series connection in Option page. \n- You can record yourself by turning on recording function in Option page.\nVisit the #BeFearless website at www.samsung.com/launchingpeople and look for our tutorial videos for detailed information on how to get started. \n\nFear Ends Where Courage Begins. \nSamsung Launching People\n#BeFearless",
