        "description": "- Explore a snowy mountain valley on a hang glider. \n- A relaxing flight through this stunning landscape with frozen lakes and forests. \n- Use your body to control the flight like in a real hang glider.\n- Use boost rings for a longer flight. \n- Try to find a mysterious crash site.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Real parked hang glider.\n- Structure simulating a hang glider.\n- Sensory swing.\n- Hammock chair / Swing. (Simulates a supine hang glider.)\n(less comfortable)\n- Working at height equipment.\n- Nest swing.\n- Hammock.\n(Uncomfortable)\n- Mechanic creeper / Platform trolley.\n- Horizontal tire swing.\n(Do not use)\n- Chair with wheels.\n- Swings with little body contact area.\n\nTips:\n- Suction Cup Grab Bars are a safe and practical alternative to fixed bars.\n- Use a fan to increase the feeling of immersion.\n\nSafety:\n- Do not use open hooks, lateral movements can cause the rig to come loose from the hook, use carabiners instead.\n- Do not use chairs with wheels, a wheel could lock sideways and overturn the chair.\n- Do not use improvised or poorly fixed bars.\n- Wrap the bar with foam and use a mattress below your body.\n- Never use handrails in high places as a bar.\n- It is recommended that you always have someone close to help in any situation.\n\nThis is a challenging and laborious Quest port of the classic Unreal Landscape Mountains Showcase. \nAll credits to the talented team at Epic Games related to the original project.
