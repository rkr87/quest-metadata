(we think…)\n\nFixes include a really bad bug that would happen when saving/loading universes during the last half of the narrative stream - this bug could cause all sorts of havoc, including breaking the “saving wade” sequence, virus again, etc. \n\nWhile there may still be lingering unknown issues, the build should be in solid shape now!  Kindly let us know if you run into any more problems, and we’ll fix ‘em right away.\n\nMAJOR FIXES:\n\n-Fixed issue where any universes loaded during the last half of the narrative stream would fire off all the starting logic for the last half of the stream (logic that should only ever fire once…), CAUSING HAVOC. (Fixed OnStart on logic_choreo_scene ents firing again when a level was restored on any choreo ents which were currently running)\n-Fixed traitor not being damageable. (Fixed scripted sequences saving the incorrect state of NPC damageability and setting NPCs to be non-damagable after their animation state ended. This is only the case where a save was made durring an NPC scripted animation. NPCs damage state is properly restored now.)\n-Fixed “pawn 1 dead” global not being set, and put some extra insurance to try and help some saved universes be in sync.  (this bug was accidently introduced just before 1.0.0…).\n-Music volume levels and attenuation settings fixed up across the entire stream\n-Fixed issue where a big chunk of the new king convo was inaccessible for everyone\n-Fixed non-progression that would occur at the end of the convo with Kiril in the brig if he disliked the seeker\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Improved how NPCs which fall out of the map are handled. This fixes cases of loading universes and NPCs falling out of the stream environment, causing NPC dialog logic to fire erroneously.\n-Fixed incorrect group sequence being assigned to a zenlil 1 choreo scene\n-Fixed proximity sphere around initial stealth merc standoff not turning off in time which fired standoff groups which shouldn't fire if the player has already started attacking\n-”Killed by” text in ending screen will now not include an \"a {thing}\" unless refering to an enemy unit, not an NPC name\n-Fixed traitor not attacking the player during confrontation in bishop 8s cabin if the player mildly attacks them first\n-Fixed traitor not wearing VR deck in cabin confrontation\n-Fixed suffocation event not turning off in Bishop 6's cabin\n-Cleaned up jank from info console buttons\n-Fixed issue with the \"k15 and Wade dancing” vid\n-Fixed issue where traitor did not appear to materialize her KAR in during the confrontation.\n-Fixed broken mission pod 1 launch sequence erroneously firing and the pod itself appearing to be back in the hangar bay briefly\n-Fixed k15 line cutting off during saving wade\n-Fixed lights being turned off when confronting traitor in b8's cabin - now lights only all go off for the traitor battle.\n-Filled in collision holes in hangar bay\n-Fixed Kiril not appearing to grab the cell bars correctly. (fixed kiril not able to have lower body bones gesture influence because of the looping scripted idle sequence he was in)\n-Fixed traitor getting stuck in a super angered state if they were attacking the bishop before being knocked out and put in the brig\n-Fixed issue where chapter saves caused hitches in NPC dialog\n-Fixed failing \"confront ###\" objective too early when players can still technically complete it\n-Fixed transform track in queen line\n-Fixed all “Kiril intro pre-EMP attack” K15 chair bouncing\n-Fixed the jank caused by a posture anim on pawn 64 being applied while he was in a movement sequence\n-Pawn 64 will now correctly stop his movement if he is close to the bishop while running to him to talk to him\n-Fixed being able to sneak by pawn 64 when agreeing to talk in the cabin and breaking things (rare).\n\nMissile Defense:\n-Fixed ending conditions of “Easy” so it doesn't end so early\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Updated localization with latest changes\n-Tweaked lounge window virus behaviour \n-Suffocation damage reduced from 20 to 4.\n\nMissile Defense:\n-Slightly boosted difficulty of Easy missile defense\n-Boosted difficulty of final wave of hard missile defense"

We are watching all feedback closely - kindly consider posting any issues you find in the Bugs and Issues forum either on Discord, or here on Steam.\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Fixed Quest hands being completely broken\n-Fixed hand direction movement control for VR which had a couple of issues. It used the wrong direction for movement AND was the wrong hand.\n-fixed being able to open the bishop menu in limbo\n-fixed the laser dot not showing on menus in VR\n-Fixed issue where players could get stuck on the bed, causing a non-progression.\n-Fixed issues where the VT Civilian Defense scenarios could not be loaded/played at all, due to an issue we introduced just before 1.0.0 �\n-Fixed timing issues around K15 coming to her office and the player arriving at the office that were pretty bad in the case where players just spoke to pawn 64.\n-All PC keyboard and controller bindings no longer affect VR mode in any way.

This is an early “release candidate”. All that remains: further testing, fixing bugs and important polish. \n\nWe would love any and all gameplay feedback for the newly updated (possibly finished?) civilian defense VT scenarios. Major improvements to civilian AI!\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Setup controller image screens with labels for deck, xbox, oculus, and index. \n-Hooked up radar charts to the end game career record. \n-Split incapping beam sounds between incap and healing - healing now has a sound that is in sync with the time it takes to heal things.\n-Adding impulse now from the CEAR laser so you can push people with it\n-Radial damage is now properly calculated\n-Friendly fire lock check has returned! Supports VR as well now.\n-Fixed radial damage against shielded enemies not orientating the shield mesh in the right direction\n-Finished/Fixed VT “Death Gauntlet” example level with built in editor - 10 soldiers and 6 civies total. Now with patrol nodes. Tuned and tweak for fun - I think it's a neat little \"puzzle\" level now. \n-Skin will now show gore if damaged by bullets fire\n-Shock grenades now do way less stamina damage per blast - result is more instances of \"enemies temporarily shocked\" rather than straight to unconciousness.\n-Frag grenades now do way more stamina damage and less health per blast - now, shielded combatants (even just 1 strommon shield) will still be alive after one frag grenade, BUT they will likely be knocked unconscious unless heavily shielded.\n-Polished frag grenade and shock grenade explosion sound cues\n-The player can now recycle grenades, but you have to be quick!\n-Zenlil Core “broken” sound polish\n-5 new lounge screens added to the rotation.\n-improvements to the physics ragdoll bodies. Less spring when ragdolling them in different downed poses. It is pretty hard to fix overall because the animation forces the body to intersect the ground at several points and the physics engine trys to de-penetrate those bodies when ragdolled.\n-VT Civilian Defense 2: New time based leaderboard score modifier calculated when level ends successfully. Score gets boost if the VIP is saved in 15 minutes or less. Largest boost: if completed in 50 seconds or under (can you do it?)\n\nVR fixes and improvements:\n-virtual desktop XR runtime support\n-fixed missing controller icons for VR (tutorial video and message board)\n-tutorial videos play with time dilation for VR and paused for non-VR. Pausing breaks so many things in VR unfortunately…\n-disabling oculus OpenXR plugin in PC packages. This should fix the issues with running in steam. \n-ditched buggy HP mixed reality controller plugin… (note:  game still supports HP mixed reality headsets/controllers, this plugin has simply been deprecated).\n-fixed controller button highlighting showing in VR mode\n-fixed not being able to get back to the main menu in VR using Oculus Link through SteamVR\n-VR controller text updates when you switch from left handed to right handed\n-Bishop menu opens with the unused VR controller button\n\nMissile Defense:\n-Fighter bullets hit c3800 more often now, all three C3800 shield types are triggered more often now from incoming gunfire.\n-Changed up kill numbers that relate to dynamic difficulty increases, changed \"starting period\" difficulty numbers for better initial pacing.\n\nVT Civilian Defense 3:\n-Now player exit is only up top and has the animated tall tower thingy\n-Spawns mostly finished\n-New center geometry - the power or computer core for the station once it becomes operational.\n-More cover added in various spots, spawning times tuned and loadouts modifed for difficulty - it's definitely a fun/hard challenge now. Very hard to not lose civies.\n-Loading animation polish\n\nVT Civilian AI:\n-Civilians will no longer try to move places when knocked down\n-Soldiers will no longer target immobile civilians\n-Civilians will now cower if shot while not running some place\n-Civilians will no longer stop following the player if shot, unless they are knocked down or killed of course\n-Civilians will no longer give up on hiding if they are spotted, but will try to move to better hiding spots if possible\n-Civilians will no longer say scared lines about knocked down soldiers\n-Civilians being attacked will ONLY run to a hiding spot if they aren't already following the player\n-Will now not show civilian talk actions over their head IF the civie is immobile\n-CEAR laser and bolts now do damage to vt civies.\n\nSteamdeck / 100% controller mode:\n-Can now cancel selection of drop down option via B button or whatever is bound to MenuDeSelect\n-Hiding more PC glyphs when in steamdeck / big picture mode\n-Online subsystem queries now all come from the cached gameinstance pointer instead of re-creating each call which spammed the console\n-More fixes and improvements to difference between mouse/keyboard mode and pure controller mode\n-Info console text field now controller focusable which will summon the virtual keyboard on steamdeck\n-InputMode changes are now considiated into the game mode so it is always known when an input mode is active and when to show / hide the cursor if needed\n-Fixed not being able to dismiss tutorials using controller\n-Can now recycle using the trigger if PCU is full. Also fixes the crosshair icon not changing.\n-Fixed flickering hotslots on steamdeck when using the gyro\n-Setting resolution to steamdeck native on steamdeck and forcing fullscreen mode on steamdeck and big picture mode\n-fixed xbox inverse face button colors and changed button glyphs to mock modern design\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Removed delay for changing the merc disposition after Kiril is downed\n-Added more force to shotgun shell blasts\n-Reduced itempiercingAmmo (KAR ammo) storage space from 35 to 10\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Oculus Leaderboards up and running for the Quest\n-More improvements to showing world HUD ISS's. This change fixes some more cases of blipping ISS windows for talk anywhere convos and more VR cases. They should be all fixed now. ;)\n-fixed another bug with mobile low clouds where they weren't horizon blending because of precision loss... This was supposed to be easy ;)\n-fixed clouds script sometimes trying to reference the clouds sequence too early\n-fixed lower scores overriding higher scores for the leaderboards\n-CEAR bolt release events will no longer cause errors when the weapon has been dropped by the AI while bolts are being released\n-fixed combat not starting when AIs disposition is changed not from being attacked\n-fixed Kiril talking while dead or unconscious (\"kill the bastard, kill him now\")\n-fixed issues with not being able to loot unconcious Kiril if he is gassed\n-mostly fixed legacy iDGi-1 issues with the visual accuracy of Kiril being gassed in the brig (developing…)\n-fixed bullet trajectory being affected by the invisible capsule used by the AIs. This would cause the players bullets to go in strange directions if the capsule was in the way of the players shots.
