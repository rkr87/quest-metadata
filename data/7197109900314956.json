This is an early “release candidate”. All that remains: further testing, fixing bugs and important polish. \n\nWe would love any and all gameplay feedback for the newly updated (possibly finished?) civilian defense VT scenarios. Major improvements to civilian AI!\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Setup controller image screens with labels for deck, xbox, oculus, and index. \n-Hooked up radar charts to the end game career record. \n-Split incapping beam sounds between incap and healing - healing now has a sound that is in sync with the time it takes to heal things.\n-Adding impulse now from the CEAR laser so you can push people with it\n-Radial damage is now properly calculated\n-Friendly fire lock check has returned! Supports VR as well now.\n-Fixed radial damage against shielded enemies not orientating the shield mesh in the right direction\n-Finished/Fixed VT “Death Gauntlet” example level with built in editor - 10 soldiers and 6 civies total. Now with patrol nodes. Tuned and tweak for fun - I think it's a neat little \"puzzle\" level now. \n-Skin will now show gore if damaged by bullets fire\n-Shock grenades now do way less stamina damage per blast - result is more instances of \"enemies temporarily shocked\" rather than straight to unconciousness.\n-Frag grenades now do way more stamina damage and less health per blast - now, shielded combatants (even just 1 strommon shield) will still be alive after one frag grenade, BUT they will likely be knocked unconscious unless heavily shielded.\n-Polished frag grenade and shock grenade explosion sound cues\n-The player can now recycle grenades, but you have to be quick!\n-Zenlil Core “broken” sound polish\n-5 new lounge screens added to the rotation.\n-improvements to the physics ragdoll bodies. Less spring when ragdolling them in different downed poses. It is pretty hard to fix overall because the animation forces the body to intersect the ground at several points and the physics engine trys to de-penetrate those bodies when ragdolled.\n-VT Civilian Defense 2: New time based leaderboard score modifier calculated when level ends successfully. Score gets boost if the VIP is saved in 15 minutes or less. Largest boost: if completed in 50 seconds or under (can you do it?)\n\nVR fixes and improvements:\n-virtual desktop XR runtime support\n-fixed missing controller icons for VR (tutorial video and message board)\n-tutorial videos play with time dilation for VR and paused for non-VR. Pausing breaks so many things in VR unfortunately…\n-disabling oculus OpenXR plugin in PC packages. This should fix the issues with running in steam. \n-ditched buggy HP mixed reality controller plugin… (note:  game still supports HP mixed reality headsets/controllers, this plugin has simply been deprecated).\n-fixed controller button highlighting showing in VR mode\n-fixed not being able to get back to the main menu in VR using Oculus Link through SteamVR\n-VR controller text updates when you switch from left handed to right handed\n-Bishop menu opens with the unused VR controller button\n\nMissile Defense:\n-Fighter bullets hit c3800 more often now, all three C3800 shield types are triggered more often now from incoming gunfire.\n-Changed up kill numbers that relate to dynamic difficulty increases, changed \"starting period\" difficulty numbers for better initial pacing.\n\nVT Civilian Defense 3:\n-Now player exit is only up top and has the animated tall tower thingy\n-Spawns mostly finished\n-New center geometry - the power or computer core for the station once it becomes operational.\n-More cover added in various spots, spawning times tuned and loadouts modifed for difficulty - it's definitely a fun/hard challenge now. Very hard to not lose civies.\n-Loading animation polish\n\nVT Civilian AI:\n-Civilians will no longer try to move places when knocked down\n-Soldiers will no longer target immobile civilians\n-Civilians will now cower if shot while not running some place\n-Civilians will no longer stop following the player if shot, unless they are knocked down or killed of course\n-Civilians will no longer give up on hiding if they are spotted, but will try to move to better hiding spots if possible\n-Civilians will no longer say scared lines about knocked down soldiers\n-Civilians being attacked will ONLY run to a hiding spot if they aren't already following the player\n-Will now not show civilian talk actions over their head IF the civie is immobile\n-CEAR laser and bolts now do damage to vt civies.\n\nSteamdeck / 100% controller mode:\n-Can now cancel selection of drop down option via B button or whatever is bound to MenuDeSelect\n-Hiding more PC glyphs when in steamdeck / big picture mode\n-Online subsystem queries now all come from the cached gameinstance pointer instead of re-creating each call which spammed the console\n-More fixes and improvements to difference between mouse/keyboard mode and pure controller mode\n-Info console text field now controller focusable which will summon the virtual keyboard on steamdeck\n-InputMode changes are now considiated into the game mode so it is always known when an input mode is active and when to show / hide the cursor if needed\n-Fixed not being able to dismiss tutorials using controller\n-Can now recycle using the trigger if PCU is full. Also fixes the crosshair icon not changing.\n-Fixed flickering hotslots on steamdeck when using the gyro\n-Setting resolution to steamdeck native on steamdeck and forcing fullscreen mode on steamdeck and big picture mode\n-fixed xbox inverse face button colors and changed button glyphs to mock modern design\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Removed delay for changing the merc disposition after Kiril is downed\n-Added more force to shotgun shell blasts\n-Reduced itempiercingAmmo (KAR ammo) storage space from 35 to 10\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Oculus Leaderboards up and running for the Quest\n-More improvements to showing world HUD ISS's. This change fixes some more cases of blipping ISS windows for talk anywhere convos and more VR cases. They should be all fixed now. ;)\n-fixed another bug with mobile low clouds where they weren't horizon blending because of precision loss... This was supposed to be easy ;)\n-fixed clouds script sometimes trying to reference the clouds sequence too early\n-fixed lower scores overriding higher scores for the leaderboards\n-CEAR bolt release events will no longer cause errors when the weapon has been dropped by the AI while bolts are being released\n-fixed combat not starting when AIs disposition is changed not from being attacked\n-fixed Kiril talking while dead or unconscious (\"kill the bastard, kill him now\")\n-fixed issues with not being able to loot unconcious Kiril if he is gassed\n-mostly fixed legacy iDGi-1 issues with the visual accuracy of Kiril being gassed in the brig (developing…)\n-fixed bullet trajectory being affected by the invisible capsule used by the AIs. This would cause the players bullets to go in strange directions if the capsule was in the way of the players shots. Ragdoll AIs whose capsule was left around the world would cause this the most.\n-fixed dazed AIs not firing at the player and improved the stagger applied to dazed AIs and improved the stagger of AIs shooting at the player while they are running fast.\n-fixed AI relationship reverting mercs back to attacking the player while they are escaping because of a delay before attacking if you attacked kiril\n-fixed all inventory weapons set to visible when respawning or dieing in the VT\n-fixed VT active weapon not being destroyed when respawning, changing level, or dying in the VT\n-fixed loading a VR save on 2D mode causing weapon bullet hit location to be calculated incorrectly\n-fixed ammos not being combined in the PCU if PCU is full of utility\n-fixed up multiple broken \"Wade zapped by core\" VO / SFX timings\n-Now turning off the cockpit button (and changing cockpit skin) that shows K15 and Wade dancing just before the global check is made. Fixes issue of video apparently being ignored by Wade.\n-R13 no longer faces p64 while walking away after cabin incident\n-Updated iDGi-1’s accuracy state of the virtual window above the chessboard in Lounge, will now no longer be erroneous when it is not supposed to be.\n-fixed pawn12 and pawn24 not being in the Barracks at the end if players never entered the med bay in Z2 and had the traitor fight.\n-fixed rare bug where Pawn 1 could appear to be alive, but iDGi-1 thinks he is dead - the logic that kills him now properly disables the logic that triggers from saving him.\n-Fixed some recyclables not being visible on Quest devices\n-fixed draw distance on bishop 8 suit locker parts, culled from galley\n\nVT Editor:\n--Fixed editor windows sometimes getting overlapped because they get too large or falling off screen in 2D mode\n--Fixed editor tools broken in VR in general...\n--Fixed invisible floors blocking interaction traces in VR\n\nMissile Defense: \n-fixed VT Missile Defense score spam issue - now properly lowers score by one point per missile that explodes into C3800\n-fixed issue where the scenario would always be set to “easy” because of a missing \"_\" in the global name being checked when turning miningame on.\n-fixed issue with overlapping and non repeating music\n-fixed enemy fighters not firing missiles which was broken by very recent difficulty improvements\n\nVT Civilian Defense 3:\n-fixed not being able to get into wilconson ceiling\n-fixed issues with respawning\n-fixed issues that stemmed from a failed cast in the CivDef3 level blueprint, due to the wilconson level not having loaded yet\n-fixed a whole bunch of missing collision in newly created level geo.\""

These were accidentally added via a recent patch from choreo polishing work and sadly caused the game to just stop in many cases. If your game was affected by this, you may have to turn back time to just after the Zenlil Missile Defense sequence to avoid issues. We will work hard to make sure something like this never happens again and apologize for the inconvenience it may have caused.\n\nC3800 Defense Minigame:  \n-Fixed laser beams not appearing to hold their fire onto fighters and solidified and fixed some other bugs in the code around them. Lasers will now never get “stuck on”.\n\n- Fixed cabin door models not aligned to the track causing noticable gaps\n- Fixed battery crawl lights not assigned to the room\n- Fixed galley light not flickering with the light itself\n- All console chairs now have a basic collision so the player cannot walk through them anymore\n- Did a complete pass of the collision turning off \"can step up on\" in cases where the player in 2D mode could step up onto things like chairs for example which felt odd\n- Fixed being able to stand on K15s platform, added player collision in replacement.\n- Added collision for more cases where the player could walk through things\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Major player conversation choice improvements to many conversations across the entire narrative. In addition to being able to say new things to almost everyone, most convos can now be easily ended by players choosing to say a natural “ending” line. Convos with Kiril, Rook 13, Pawn 44, Knight 15, Pawn 12, Pawn 4, Knight 18, Pawn 24, Pawn 32, Rook 9, Pawn 64, Pawn 11, Pawn 19, the Consortium Queen, Pawn 62, Pawn 51, Rook 25, Petar, the Consortium King have all received this treatment.\n\n-C3800 Defense Minigame FX now complete. Explosions and related FX all polished up, now make more use of bloom. \n\n-New lounge advertisements!  More ads now show in the rotation in the Zenlil Lounge. Developing…\n\n-Completed major choreography polish pass to all of the mission ops ensemble “Holo Kiril” conversations. R25, K15 and R13 are now more present in all scenes. Major eye movement improvements for everyone.\n\nVirtual Trainer editor:\n- Fixed selections in the drop down menus not always showing what was actually suppose to be selected (a bunch of edge cases fixed here)\n- Completely redid the layout of the VT editor front end window which greatly reduces how cluttered it used to be and makes it read better\n- Setup most controller navigation in the VT editor front end window.\n\n-New ending:  Big Quantum Limbo 3 changes. Major landscape changes/improvements, more fleshed out.  Developing…\n\n-Updated/finished intro “partial dream” sequence in B6’s cabin.\n\n-Credits video updated. (One final credits video update remains, when the project reaches v1.0…)\n\n- Improved the bed collision on all cabin beds\n\n- Added some missing labels for chairs\""

Regression caused by changing the meshes to world static from world dynamic\n-Fixed shields still negating damage even when disabled\n-Fixed the computer core material being busted from the shield FX updates\n-Fixed K15 animation issue where she would \"jerk\" into position at the end of her first line when you get the CMC from her.\n-Fixed Kiril bouncing back and forth like he was confused about who to look at during mission ops holo convo.\n-Fixed instances where K15 was putting her arm into her chair \n-Fixed frag grenades doing no damage\n-Fixed the weapon in your hand being destroyed when entering the VT\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Kiril now actually looks at player when he says \"let the men talk...\"\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n- Added sprint to VR mode\n- Added fall damage to VR mode\n- Added super jump to VR mode\n- 2D / VR Unified Save / Restore:  Universes saved in VR can now be seamlessly brought into 2D mode, and vice versa. Saves made with CONSORTIUM Remastered Playtest will now load with CONSORTIUM VR!\n- Time dilation no longer occurs in the radial or bishop menu when weapon safety is active. This will reduce the times when voice lines can do a little erroneous repeating at the end plus dilation isn't needed when the Bishop isn't in danger. A proper solution to the voice repeating is in the works.\n- The zenlil map is back at the stations located at forward deck 2, the lounge, the barracks, and the med bay. You can now click locations on the Zenlil map to show floor indicators to that room\n- Added a new “cast member” selection screen for selecting traitor.  \n-Per player feedback, players now have many different lines to end conversations with Rook 25, Rook 9, Pawn 19 and Pawn 32. Various edits and improvements to choreography.\n-Final choreography polishing of “Holo Kiril” Mission Ops conversation. R25 and K15 now present in many scenes they were not before. (80% done).\n- AIs will now enable and disable their shields depending on arousal state (if any  enemy detection state is happening…) and shows an effect of them going up or down\n-VR Secondary Arm HUD Alignment Button \"pulse\" animation added, fires whenever there are new unseen alignment changes in the iDGi Alignment screen. \n-Content added for a super-late-to-the-party \"immortalize yourself\" 2013 KS backer reward. (Pawn7's bunk now has a family photo…)\n-J.W. choreo edits / improvements / additions\n- Kiril will now climb out of the hole to enter the battle\n- controller mode menu buttons now use a unified interface, an addition to the new HUD push/pop system and modalness\n\n-C3800 DEFENSE MINIGAME: Now adding to an array of all F35 missiles in play and checking that at the end of play, the game will no longer end until all active missiles are out of play.\n\nNew Ending:\n-Started expansion of Dream Tunnel 3, aka Quantum Limbo…some new items can be discovered. \""

Various fighters flight paths veer much closer to player now\n-Added \"stop firing\" events into gun fire events so the muzzle flash turns off at correct times.\n-Hard mode now involves even more incoming F35 missiles and gunfire. Easy mode is less..  More chaos/randomness added throughout all modes.\n-Added system where if player is continuously holding down fire button, lasers will automatically fire at incoming targetted missiles every 0.25 seconds. Player must rapid fire trigger to blast new targets any faster.\n-Various balancing improvements\n-Improvements to how the fight ends - now on Hard, all combatants will stay and fight, no more fleeing.\n-Higher upper limit of F35 missile firing frequency established and hooked up to if players kill 15 or more Fighters with lasers and are playing on hard. Controller Struct bools now set for two new modes that will come online based on ever increasing player kill counts. Developing…\n\nVIRTUAL TRAINER and Editor:\n- General Steam leaderboard scoring now in for all Virtual Trainer scenarios (except VT missile defense). Killing guys vs incapping rewards higher payouts, saving civilians rewards. Stealth challenges are based on how fast you can complete the level.\n- added VT score indication\n- Updated \"held in heat\" example custom VT level with sub squads to prevent all AIs from clumping you on first sight.

Other things will be added in the future.\n- Fixed talk anywhere ISS dialogs getting stuck on where an AI was standing when they were removed from the world. Happened a lot at the end of rescuing hostages.\n- Added being able to set the initial Utility energy the player starts with in a custom VT editor level\n- Fixed squad setting not working for characters in the VT editor levels\n- Added \"exit\" and \"hiding spot\" AI nodes to the VT editor for use by the civilian AIs\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Hopeful fix for steam achievements not firing.\n- NPC chair sit animations now pause once they are in the idle state to prevent the animation from continuing off the end at some point and ejecting the NPC (fixing the “NPCs floating near their chairs” issue many have reported - thank-you!).\n- Fixed getting stuck in chairs (cockpit chair most likely but any non-rotating chair was possible). This was a regression caused by the new vehicle driving code used by rotating chairs.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n- Kirils name in subtitle will now be kiril angelov, not Homeless mercs leader.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Language setting is now enabled, English and Spanish (V.O.I.C.E. supported).
