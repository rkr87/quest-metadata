                "change_log": "\"CONSORTIUM VR / Remastered: Release Candidate 1 (v0.1.45)\n\nMany VR fixes, finishing touches, various critical fixes, major Steamdeck support improvements, VT levels finished and more. This is an early “release candidate”. All that remains: further testing, fixing bugs and important polish. \n\nWe would love any and all gameplay feedback for the newly updated (possibly finished?) civilian defense VT scenarios. Major improvements to civilian AI!\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Setup controller image screens with labels for deck, xbox, oculus, and index. \n-Hooked up radar charts to the end game career record. \n-Split incapping beam sounds between incap and healing - healing now has a sound that is in sync with the time it takes to heal things.\n-Adding impulse now from the CEAR laser so you can push people with it\n-Radial damage is now properly calculated\n-Friendly fire lock check has returned! Supports VR as well now.\n-Fixed radial damage against shielded enemies not orientating the shield mesh in the right direction\n-Finished/Fixed VT “Death Gauntlet” example level with built in editor - 10 soldiers and 6 civies total. Now with patrol nodes. Tuned and tweak for fun - I think it's a neat little \"puzzle\" level now. \n-Skin will now show gore if damaged by bullets fire\n-Shock grenades now do way less stamina damage per blast - result is more instances of \"enemies temporarily shocked\" rather than straight to unconciousness.\n-Frag grenades now do way more stamina damage and less health per blast - now, shielded combatants (even just 1 strommon shield) will still be alive after one frag grenade, BUT they will likely be knocked unconscious unless heavily shielded.\n-Polished frag grenade and shock grenade explosion sound cues\n-The player can now recycle grenades, but you have to be quick!\n-Zenlil Core “broken” sound polish\n-5 new lounge screens added to the rotation.\n-improvements to the physics ragdoll bodies. Less spring when ragdolling them in different downed poses. It is pretty hard to fix overall because the animation forces the body to intersect the ground at several points and the physics engine trys to de-penetrate those bodies when ragdolled.\n-VT Civilian Defense 2: New time based leaderboard score modifier calculated when level ends successfully. Score gets boost if the VIP is saved in 15 minutes or less. Largest boost: if completed in 50 seconds or under (can you do it?)\n\nVR fixes and improvements:\n-virtual desktop XR runtime support\n-fixed missing controller icons for VR (tutorial video and message board)\n-tutorial videos play with time dilation for VR and paused for non-VR. Pausing breaks so many things in VR unfortunately…\n-disabling oculus OpenXR plugin in PC packages. This should fix the issues with running in steam. \n-ditched buggy HP mixed reality controller plugin… (note:  game still supports HP mixed reality headsets/controllers, this plugin has simply been deprecated).\n-fixed controller button highlighting showing in VR mode\n-fixed not being able to get back to the main menu in VR using Oculus Link through SteamVR\n-VR controller text updates when you switch from left handed to right handed\n-Bishop menu opens with the unused VR controller button\n\nMissile Defense:\n-Fighter bullets hit c3800 more often now, all three C3800 shield types are triggered more often now from incoming gunfire.\n-Changed up kill numbers that relate to dynamic difficulty increases, changed \"starting period\" difficulty numbers for better initial pacing.\n\nVT Civilian Defense 3:\n-Now player exit is only up top and has the animated tall tower thingy\n-Spawns mostly finished\n-New center geometry - the power or computer core for the station once it becomes operational.\n-More cover added in various spots, spawning times tuned and loadouts modifed for difficulty - it's definitely a fun/hard challenge now. Very hard to not lose civies.\n-Loading animation polish\n\nVT Civilian AI:\n-Civilians will no longer try to move places when knocked down\n-Soldiers will no longer target immobile civilians\n-Civilians will now cower if shot while not running some place\n-Civilians will no longer stop following the player if shot, unless they are knocked down or killed of course\n-Civilians will no longer give up on hiding if they are spotted, but will try to move to better hiding spots if possible\n-Civilians will no longer say scared lines about knocked down soldiers\n-Civilians being attacked will ONLY run to a hiding spot if they aren't already following the player\n-Will now not show civilian talk actions over their head IF the civie is immobile\n-CEAR laser and bolts now do damage to vt civies.\n\nSteamdeck / 100% controller mode:\n-Can now cancel selection of drop down option via B button or whatever is bound to MenuDeSelect\n-Hiding more PC glyphs when in steamdeck / big picture mode\n-Online subsystem queries now all come from the cached gameinstance pointer instead of re-creating each call which spammed the console\n-More fixes and improvements to difference between mouse/keyboard mode and pure controller mode\n-Info console text field now controller focusable which will summon the virtual keyboard on steamdeck\n-InputMode changes are now considiated into the game mode so it is always known when an input mode is active and when to show / hide the cursor if needed\n-Fixed not being able to dismiss tutorials using controller\n-Can now recycle using the trigger if PCU is full. Also fixes the crosshair icon not changing.\n-Fixed flickering hotslots on steamdeck when using the gyro\n-Setting resolution to steamdeck native on steamdeck and forcing fullscreen mode on steamdeck and big picture mode\n-fixed xbox inverse face button colors and changed button glyphs to mock modern design\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Removed delay for changing the merc disposition after Kiril is downed\n-Added more force to shotgun shell blasts\n-Reduced itempiercingAmmo (KAR ammo) storage space from 35 to 10\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Oculus Leaderboards up and running for the Quest\n-More improvements to showing world HUD ISS's. This change fixes some more cases of blipping ISS windows for talk anywhere convos and more VR cases. They should be all fixed now. ;)\n-fixed another bug with mobile low clouds where they weren't horizon blending because of precision loss... This was supposed to be easy ;)\n-fixed clouds script sometimes trying to reference the clouds sequence too early\n-fixed lower scores overriding higher scores for the leaderboards\n-CEAR bolt release events will no longer cause errors when the weapon has been dropped by the AI while bolts are being released\n-fixed combat not starting when AIs disposition is changed not from being attacked\n-fixed Kiril talking while dead or unconscious (\"kill the bastard, kill him now\")\n-fixed issues with not being able to loot unconcious Kiril if he is gassed\n-mostly fixed legacy iDGi-1 issues with the visual accuracy of Kiril being gassed in the brig (developing…)\n-fixed bullet trajectory being affected by the invisible capsule used by the AIs. This would cause the players bullets to go in strange directions if the capsule was in the way of the players shots. Ragdoll AIs whose capsule was left around the world would cause this the most.\n-fixed dazed AIs not firing at the player and improved the stagger applied to dazed AIs and improved the stagger of AIs shooting at the player while they are running fast.\n-fixed AI relationship reverting mercs back to attacking the player while they are escaping because of a delay before attacking if you attacked kiril\n-fixed all inventory weapons set to visible when respawning or dieing in the VT\n-fixed VT active weapon not being destroyed when respawning, changing level, or dying in the VT\n-fixed loading a VR save on 2D mode causing weapon bullet hit location to be calculated incorrectly\n-fixed ammos not being combined in the PCU if PCU is full of utility\n-fixed up multiple broken \"Wade zapped by core\" VO / SFX timings\n-Now turning off the cockpit button (and changing cockpit skin) that shows K15 and Wade dancing just before the global check is made. Fixes issue of video apparently being ignored by Wade.\n-R13 no longer faces p64 while walking away after cabin incident\n-Updated iDGi-1’s accuracy state of the virtual window above the chessboard in Lounge, will now no longer be erroneous when it is not supposed to be.\n-fixed pawn12 and pawn24 not being in the Barracks at the end if players never entered the med bay in Z2 and had the traitor fight.\n-fixed rare bug where Pawn 1 could appear to be alive, but iDGi-1 thinks he is dead - the logic that kills him now properly disables the logic that triggers from saving him.\n-Fixed some recyclables not being visible on Quest devices\n-fixed draw distance on bishop 8 suit locker parts, culled from galley\n\nVT Editor:\n--Fixed editor windows sometimes getting overlapped because they get too large or falling off screen in 2D mode\n--Fixed editor tools broken in VR in general...\n--Fixed invisible floors blocking interaction traces in VR\n\nMissile Defense: \n-fixed VT Missile Defense score spam issue - now properly lowers score by one point per missile that explodes into C3800\n-fixed issue where the scenario would always be set to “easy” because of a missing \"_\" in the global name being checked when turning miningame on.\n-fixed issue with overlapping and non repeating music\n-fixed enemy fighters not firing missiles which was broken by very recent difficulty improvements\n\nVT Civilian Defense 3:\n-fixed not being able to get into wilconson ceiling\n-fixed issues with respawning\n-fixed issues that stemmed from a failed cast in the CivDef3 level blueprint, due to the wilconson level not having loaded yet\n-fixed a whole bunch of missing collision in newly created level geo.\""

Fixes the issue with being able to start the K escalation early. (a case where the escalation happened too early, and the mXXXXX scene could happen at the same time, causing a major paradox).\n-Fixed sliders in the main menu not being slidable to the left without being deselected. This made setting a slider with the controller difficult.\n-Sliders are now fixed to their set increments even for mouse control.\n-increased the kill radius of the storage particle FX (picking something up) to hopefully catch storage balls not reaching their targets\n-Numorous scripting and timing fixes around the \"Save XXXX\" sequence.\n-Many critical \"look at\" and \"fade to\" choreography fixes for K15 and Kiril in entire post XXX attack and pre XXX surrender/boarding.\n-Fixed light styles not being revertable on individual stationary lights\n-Fixed def_light_style_control entity not also updating the room tint\n-Fixed wade not in group 16 causing him to look away from the player during convo limbo of group 16\n-Fixed ragdoll save / restore\n-Fixed strange case of a missing light style, source engine must have just defaulted if it couldn't find one\n-Fixed a hole in the collision geo to galley which occasionally NPCs would plop down into before springing back up...\n-Fixed R25 getting into the crawl a better way than before which would usually fail on the tail of the animation.

                "change_log": "\"CONSORTIUM VR Quest BETA v0.1.27\n\nC3800 DEFENSE MINIGAME:\n-Fixed completely broken extreme difficulty and secondary fire mode switch button. \n-Missile Defense: Fixed issue where a failed cast was causing the secondary fire button to be broken and the total number of enemies to not be set correctly. \n-Lowered volume of incoming missile warning beeps to be more subtle but still useful.\n-Fixed targeting visualization to \"pop\" more for all possible background colors\n-Now when being targeted, the original \"threat\" billboard for F35 missiles now turn off, leaving just the locked billboard.\n-All F35 Fighter attack sequences given a (hopefully!) final polish pass - flight paths and attack times adjusted and improved. Various fighters flight paths veer much closer to player now\n-Added \"stop firing\" events into gun fire events so the muzzle flash turns off at correct times.\n-Hard mode now involves even more incoming F35 missiles and gunfire. Easy mode is less..  More chaos/randomness added throughout all modes.\n-Added system where if player is continuously holding down fire button, lasers will automatically fire at incoming targetted missiles every 0.25 seconds. Player must rapid fire trigger to blast new targets any faster.\n-Various balancing improvements\n-Improvements to how the fight ends - now on Hard, all combatants will stay and fight, no more fleeing.\n-Higher upper limit of F35 missile firing frequency established and hooked up to if players kill 15 or more Fighters with lasers and are playing on hard. Controller Struct bools now set for two new modes that will come online based on ever increasing player kill counts. Developing…\n\nVIRTUAL TRAINER and Editor:\n- General Steam leaderboard scoring now in for all Virtual Trainer scenarios (except VT missile defense). Killing guys vs incapping rewards higher payouts, saving civilians rewards. Stealth challenges are based on how fast you can complete the level.\n- added VT score indication\n- Updated \"held in heat\" example custom VT level with sub squads to prevent all AIs from clumping you on first sight. Also increased the initial utility energy and added a utility charger.\n- Fixed custom VT levels walls and floors not actually collidable by AIs so they would occasionally fall through them and out of the world\n- Added \"things\" tool to the VT Editor to add Utility chargers. Other things will be added in the future.\n- Fixed talk anywhere ISS dialogs getting stuck on where an AI was standing when they were removed from the world. Happened a lot at the end of rescuing hostages.\n- Added being able to set the initial Utility energy the player starts with in a custom VT editor level\n- Fixed squad setting not working for characters in the VT editor levels\n- Added \"exit\" and \"hiding spot\" AI nodes to the VT editor for use by the civilian AIs\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Hopeful fix for steam achievements not firing.\n- NPC chair sit animations now pause once they are in the idle state to prevent the animation from continuing off the end at some point and ejecting the NPC (fixing the “NPCs floating near their chairs” issue many have reported - thank-you!).\n- Fixed getting stuck in chairs (cockpit chair most likely but any non-rotating chair was possible). This was a regression caused by the new vehicle driving code used by rotating chairs.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n- Kirils name in subtitle will now be kiril angelov, not Homeless mercs leader.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Language setting is now enabled, English and Spanish (V.O.I.C.E. supported). Only the core interface and first half of the story is translated to Spanish, we’re still working on the rest.\n-Choreography finishing - Final entire Queen/K15/K18/Player convo animation polish pass has been completed.\n-Major player choice edits and choreography improvements to final Kiril conversation and various other spots in the later half of the narrative.\n- Added new \"gameplay\" settings in front-end.\n- Added \"show character alignment changes\" option to the gameplay section. When on, all alignment changes (ISS or otherwise) will be shown as a HUD indicator (VR and flatscreen).\n- Added toggle to disable animating textures which in turn turns off the texture streaming to the game settings (this is for a test for Harlock’s machine).  If you have an older machine that has a hard time loading the game, consider toggling this option on.\""

In addition to general polishing tasks, we are now working on building the remainder of new content for the updated ending…it is coming together.\n\nWe are still very interested in learning about any bugs and technical issues any of you may be encountering and actively prioritize any serious issues found. \n\nFor those of you using the Bug Reporter: We’ve seen a few reports of issues reported that we can’t replicate. It would be extremely helpful for us if you could explain how to replicate any issue you encounter - if possible, of course.  \n\nRegardless, we truly appreciate those of you using the Bug Reporter to report technical issues you are encountering - thank-you!)\n\n\nFIXES and IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Fixed VT user scenario loading empty levels\n-Fixed recent issue where the VR game would not load correctly in Steam VR\n-We turned off blueprint nativization for PC-VR and Remastered builds, as this gets around a nasty nativization bug that caused some folks to not be able to load the game at all. This may affect performance in certain circumstances, we are still investigating.\n\nC3800 DEFENSE MINIGAME:\n-Fixed missing lasers in C3800 Defense Minigame (finally!)\n-Fixed issue where most fighter gun-fire wasn't actually hitting C3800.\n-Fixed erroneous disabled fighter sometimes appearing right beside player position even if no EMP missiles were fired.\n-Fixed locked crosshair staying on even after destroying missiles.\n-Fixed explosion particles FX disappearing before finishing.\n-Fixed issue where shields could stop charging entirely.\n-Vastly improved how the various shield charging timers turn on and off (low, emergency and normal modes)\n-Previously locked on Fighters will now instantly re-lock and set the current target for the colliding AimingDevice.\n-Added fighter fight music cue and set to music channel that turns on and loops during the sequence of using the manual weapons to defend Zenlil from attack.\n-Improvements to use of targetting widget: now locked Fighters should immediately show as \"locked\" when becoming the current target\n-A bunch of general improvements and refinements to targetting and targetting priority for choosing what the \"current target\" should be. Incoming Missiles are always highest target priority in general.\n-Changed up one attack sequence so that incoming missile vectors are more visible.\n-Fixed issue where one fighter was being erroneously used for 3 sequences, resulting in very broken looking flight-paths\n-Made the targeting cylinder 50% thinner, allowing for the needed targeting precision. Now there is just one collision cylinder for both VR and flatscreen mode (it was dumb to seperate them in the first place).\n-Slightly boosted C3800 shield damage of incoming gunfire and missile explosions.\n\n-General improvements and polish to conversation options and choreography across the last half of the narrative. The King convo in particular got a big pass, and the Queen/K18 convo choreography is measurably closer to done…\""

The gameplay fully works, you’re all just not SEEING the laser beam yet. Developing…)\n\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Fixed (for real this time) issue with Info Console images not showing up. To see an example article with multiple images, search for “sinn”...\n-Added player blocking in the cockpit seat areas\n-Fixed the timing on reactivating the cockpit seat buttons so you cannot press the button while leaving the seat\n-Fixed the universe log death damage type output\n-Fixed the test VT editor level not having a way to exit play test mode\n-Fixed another bug preventing signal texts from showing\n-Fixed VT editor level items (weapons and such from baddies) not getting cleaned up when the level ends.\n-Fixed the close menu for the bishop HUD not being available in VR mode where it is needed\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n- Made the background of the Info Console not solid black, but still dim\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Can now find J.W. somewhere. (http://johnwilconson.com) \n\nVIRTUAL TRAINER:\n-VT CivDef Level 3:  Improvements to environment, cover and platform control logic. New \"dynamic pulsing \" material for most of world. Civilian respawning logic cleaned up, platform to exit booth now turns off when not near it. More optimization.\n\n-Major VT Civilian AI and interface overhaul:  Can now use V.O.I.C.E. to command civilians to stay, follow you, run for the exit or run for cover. Civilians can be healed to keep them alive. If civilians are hurt and have a threat and are within 5000 units of a hiding spot they will head there.\n\n-Brand new Virtual Trainer mode: “USER SCENARIOS” “randomizer” mode. This is to be composed opf levels made by users of the VT Editor. Anyone can soon request a level they make with the VT editor be considered for the official list for all to play! The very first (challenging) User Scenario can be found and played right now, but an empty level will also occasionally come up.  Developing…\n\n-General improvements to conversation options and choreography in various spots in the last half of the narrative.\n-Dream landscapes polished up, have consistent theme and progression now.\n-Lounge “weather screen” image properly finished up.\n-Added missing electrocution and zapping sounds to the tazer\n\n-C3800 Zenlil Defense:  Fighters now can take up 1 second total of laser fire before exploding. Aiming/targetting cleaned up. Still a few known issues, this will still be receiving more polish. Developing…\""
