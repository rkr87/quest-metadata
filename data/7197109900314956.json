(Total now 84 and counting...)\n-Quest VR: Added rebuilding the microphone input for device sleep and awake. \n-Hooked up timers and existing choreo sequences for the player taking too long to get into the medbed, now failing the mission if player waits for too long, bed reverts to normal.\n-Virus now does more things at the moment where the player is hailed down by Pawn 64. \n-VR World ISS HUDs now use smart logic to decide which current reply NPC is more relavant to show the reply ISS HUD beside.\n-Improvements to when a world HUD should be placed / is ready to be placed because the initial bounds has been calculated\n-C3800 Defense Minigame: \n-Flatscreen: Crosshair circle added\n-Flatscreen: C3800 Minigame lock on target crosshair added\n-Old targets now stay relevant for a time in the C3800 Minigame which allows for firing when not quite on the target. Works for lasers and missile targetting.\n-Turned off fighter crosshair stuff in flatscreen.\n- reduced C3800 left side HUD to just the targetting display and the health / energy bars for non-VR/flatscreen.\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Entity output TimesToFire is now save/restored so when reloading a save those outputs will continue to be exhausted as they should. Fixes the issue with being able to start the K escalation early. (a case where the escalation happened too early, and the mXXXXX scene could happen at the same time, causing a major paradox).\n-Fixed sliders in the main menu not being slidable to the left without being deselected. This made setting a slider with the controller difficult.\n-Sliders are now fixed to their set increments even for mouse control.\n-increased the kill radius of the storage particle FX (picking something up) to hopefully catch storage balls not reaching their targets\n-Numorous scripting and timing fixes around the \"Save XXXX\" sequence.\n-Many critical \"look at\" and \"fade to\" choreography fixes for K15 and Kiril in entire post XXX attack and pre XXX surrender/boarding.\n-Fixed light styles not being revertable on individual stationary lights\n-Fixed def_light_style_control entity not also updating the room tint\n-Fixed wade not in group 16 causing him to look away from the player during convo limbo of group 16\n-Fixed ragdoll save / restore\n-Fixed strange case of a missing light style, source engine must have just defaulted if it couldn't find one\n-Fixed a hole in the collision geo to galley which occasionally NPCs would plop down into before springing back up...\n-Fixed R25 getting into the crawl a better way than before which would usually fail on the tail of the animation. This issue was probably what caused her to enter mission ops crouched from time to time.\n-Cannot pause while demo fading out\n-Fixed all of the door gaps (where you can see the sky on the other side because the room is culled) that I could find.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Tweaked bloom of fluorescent lights on ceiling to be just a tad brighter.\n-C3800 Defense Minigame: \n-Doubled size of EMP missile collision capsule to mitigate issue of missiles sometimes flying around a target like crazy\n-Reduced fighter target lock-on time from 1.5s to 1.0s\n-Some mesh distance culling tweaks\n-Some tweaks to the specularity on some surfaces around zenlil.\n-Toned down b8 cabin light\n-Updated button to open the hatch to the cockpit to read ‘Hatch to the Cockpit’ instead of ‘Hatch to Upper Avionics’\""

Players must shut down all spawners to open ending. Finalized loadouts, spawn counts/patrols, level completion logic, animated ending squar., \n-The VT now unlocks after the briefing.\n-Fixed XXXX disintegration sequence having animation spazzes due to unnecessary anims in level sequences.

These were accidentally added via a recent patch from choreo polishing work and sadly caused the game to just stop in many cases. If your game was affected by this, you may have to turn back time to just after the Zenlil Missile Defense sequence to avoid issues.

In addition to being able to say new things to almost everyone, most convos can now be easily ended by players choosing to say a natural “ending” line. Convos with Kiril, Rook 13, Pawn 44, Knight 15, Pawn 12, Pawn 4, Knight 18, Pawn 24, Pawn 32, Rook 9, Pawn 64, Pawn 11, Pawn 19, the Consortium Queen, Pawn 62, Pawn 51, Rook 25, Petar, the Consortium King have all received this treatment.\n\n-C3800 Defense Minigame FX now complete. Explosions and related FX all polished up, now make more use of bloom. \n\n-New lounge advertisements!  More ads now show in the rotation in the Zenlil Lounge. Developing…\n\n-Completed major choreography polish pass to all of the mission ops ensemble “Holo Kiril” conversations. R25, K15 and R13 are now more present in all scenes. Major eye movement improvements for everyone.\n\nVirtual Trainer editor:\n- Fixed selections in the drop down menus not always showing what was actually suppose to be selected (a bunch of edge cases fixed here)\n- Completely redid the layout of the VT editor front end window which greatly reduces how cluttered it used to be and makes it read better\n- Setup most controller navigation in the VT editor front end window.\n\n-New ending:  Big Quantum Limbo 3 changes.

This will reduce the times when voice lines can do a little erroneous repeating at the end plus dilation isn't needed when the Bishop isn't in danger. A proper solution to the voice repeating is in the works.\n- The zenlil map is back at the stations located at forward deck 2, the lounge, the barracks, and the med bay.
