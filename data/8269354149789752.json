        "description": "Balloon Burst is an exciting exergame specifically designed for rehabilitation and physical therapy, combining fun with functional movement exercises. In this game, players must walk around the room to pop balloons floating all around them, promoting mobility and improving walking abilities. Each balloon burst contributes to a higher score and a more active, engaged rehabilitation experience.\n\nCreated for use in rehabilitation centers and physical therapy programs, Balloon Burst is ideal for patients recovering from injuries, surgeries, or those looking to strengthen their lower body. The game motivates players to engage in active movements, such as walking, turning, and stretching, which are essential in recovery and mobility improvement. By popping as many balloons as possible, players improve their balance, coordination, and stamina while having a blast!\n\nWhether you're working on rebuilding walking strength or enhancing mobility, Balloon Burst offers an enjoyable and effective way to make progress. It encourages patients to be more active and interactive during their therapy, providing an entertaining alternative to traditional exercises.\n\n**(!) Balloon Burst is part of the larger HoloMoves package, a subscription service offering a wide variety of exergames specifically designed for rehabilitation and physical therapy.
