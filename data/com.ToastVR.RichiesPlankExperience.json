        "description": "Richie's Plank Experience was designed to invoke the strongest possible emotions in the shortest possible time. Test your fear of heights or entertain your friends and family as they walk the plank 80 stories high and experience terrifying real fear, knees weak and palms sweaty!\n\nThe plank setup has been vastly improved through the use of immersive Mixed Reality on Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro devices. Adjust the position, rotation and dimensions of your in game plank to match your real world plank or create a virtual plank right in your living room!\n\nOnce you have mastered the art of walking the plank, crank it up a notch and see if you can make it through Nightmare mode. Our Halloween themed experience is a great way to scare you and your guests during the spooky season.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it feels like to fly? With our Hero Academy, you can fly through the city like a superhero, take out rockets or fight fires.\n\nWe even have a Christmas themed VR experience the whole family can enjoy. Our Santa Simulator is great for kids and family gatherings during Christmas time.\n\nWarning: This game invokes a near-instant emotional reaction. Due to the nature of virtual reality, this experience can affect your balance, cause dizziness and affect your decision making ability. Follow the in-game Safety Guidelines to reduce the risk of serious injury or harm.",
