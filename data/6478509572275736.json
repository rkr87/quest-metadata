        "description": "Lobaki's new Virtual Electrical Circuits Simulator (VECS) is an immersive hands-on tool for students to learn about electronics like never before. With over a dozen embedded lessons, students are guided through the foundations of electricity and mechatronics by building and analyzing their own circuits. VECS accurately simulates real-world components like lightbulbs, batteries, resistors, capacitors, switches, motors, and more. The simulation even includes a multimeter, allowing students to measure the real-world behavior of their circuits. The open-ended experience allows students to construct any circuit they desire, replacing the need for expensive single-use components in a traditional lab or classroom. Circuits can be safely tested (and even blown up!) in VECS, allowing students to experiment virtually before applying their skills in the real world.\n\nVECS utilizes an open source SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), specifically Ngspice, a circuit simulator that numerically solves equations describing (electronic) circuits: These are made of passive and active devices. Time varying currents and voltages are simulated as well as noise and small signal behavior.\n\nThis ensures the accuracy of the simulated components, so even after completing all the included Lessons, students can continue to explore and experiment with their own custom circuits, accurately measuring the Voltage, Current, and Resistance of each step along their personal configuration.",
