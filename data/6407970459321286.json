        "description": "# What Does Tennis Vision VR Do?\nTennis Vision VR trains all of the visual skills needed in tennis:\n\n- **Faster reactions**: So you can easily return bigger serves and have more time on your shots.\n\n- **Better anticipation**: So you can predict where your opponents are going to hit their shot.\n\n- **Quicker decision making**: So you can play the right shot at the right time, even when under pressure.\n\n- ​**Enhanced focus & concentration**: So you can make less silly errors and can play your best tennis when it matters most on the big points.\n- **Better ball tracking**: So you watch the ball more effectively through to contact to increase consistency, even when being offensive.\n\n- ​**Cleaner timing**: So you can feel more confident in your ball striking.​\n\n# Who Is Tennis Vision VR For?\nTennis Vision VR is designed for competitive tennis players who want to gain an edge over their competition. It's perfect for competitive junior/college &, professional players.\n\n# How Does Tennis Vision VR Work?\nTennis vision VR uses the concepts of applied neuroscience and neuroplasticity to make you a better player. It trains the parts of your brain that create and control all the visual skills needed for tennis.\n\nThink of it like a strength and conditioning program, but for your reactions, ball tracking, focus & decision making etc.\n\nIt takes exercises that have been tried and tested in the fields of \"functional neurology\", \"vision therapy\" & \"behavioural optometry\" and packages them into an easy to use Virtual Reality app. ",
