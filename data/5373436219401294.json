        "description": "Proper hand hygiene is considered the single most important method of preventing and controlling infections in long term care facilities. The Tork VR Clean Hands Training offers a hands-on training for care home staff to improve their hand hygiene compliance according to WHO's moments of hand hygiene. In addition, you will learn the correct hand hygiene technique. Putting on the VR headset, you get ready to start a new shift. Although you are in a virtual world, youâ€™ll face a series of real-life situations and practice hand hygiene. A study shows that 8 out of 10 healthcare professionals would like to improve their hand hygiene compliance. But traditional forms of hand hygiene training are often perceived as uninspiring. In the same way as the award winning, Tork Clean Hands Training for Hospitals, forerunner to Tork VR Clean Hands Training for Care Homes, this training invites users into a digital world where they can interact and train on the WHO's Moments For Hand Hygiene.",
