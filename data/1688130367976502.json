        "description": "It’s been nearly 10 years since Shepard Fairey’s last solo exhibition in his hometown of Los Angeles and the iconic HOPE imagery he created for then Presidential candidate Barack Obama. Now for the very first time Shepard Fairey's work has been transformed into a virtual reality experience. Experience his most ambitious show to date, aptly titled DAMAGED.\n\nIn this unprecedented political climate, Fairey’s message has changed from hope to purpose: “DAMAGED is an honest diagnosis, but diagnosis is the first step to recognizing and solving problems. \"I definitely think that art can be part of the solution because it can inspire people to look at an issue they might otherwise ignore or reject.”\n\n* Listen to over 100 minutes of exclusive narration by Shepard Fairey.\n* Interact with hundreds of artworks.\n* A full three dimensional photo realistic representation of his Damaged show.",
