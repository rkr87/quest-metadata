And good news: it's somewhere in the building! Just use the elevator down the hall. Oh, and by the way, each floor is a gateway to another world, nobody speaks your language, and time and space are fluid.\n\nOK good luck!\n\nFeatures:\n• Use your elevator to solve mind-bending puzzles in a series of connected escape rooms\n• Step out onto each floor, explore, and meet bizarre characters\n• Revisit completed puzzles to find new, remixed challenges waiting for you\n• Now with 6+ hours of hand-crafted, charming-as-heck gameplay\n• Built exclusively for VR, and designed to be comfortable for everyone\n\nDeveloped with love by Turbo Button in Los Angeles.
