Turn videos into volumetric, immersive experiences.\n\nIt features:\n- Virtual hands that react to the video environment.\n- Six-degrees-of-freedom playback: Reduce eye strain and move freely with position tracking.\n- Passthrough mode: Bring videos to your reality. Hologram-like.\n- Play in most of the common layouts (180/360/Flat in Stereo/Mono) and formats (mp4, avi, mkv, mov, webm).\n\nOther features include:\n- Local streaming: With our new server app Touchly Cast.\n- Hand tracking support.\n- TactGlove support for haptics.\n- Advanced settings: Rotation, position, color adjustment, depth adjustments, etc.\n- Depth and Color matting for passthrough.\n- Watch local or remote files with streaming.\n- Customizable hands.\n\nImportant note: To watch videos in volumetric mode, they need to be converted first with Touchly Renderer (touchly.app/renderer). Only a couple of demo videos are included in the app.",
