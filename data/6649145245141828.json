        "description": "Paint the Town Red VR brings the chaotic first person melee combat into VR with unprecedented control. A fully immersive experience that places you directly into the world of Paint the Town Red, with a host of new features designed to take full advantage of VR.\n\nWield the vast array of weapons with a new level of precision. Execute jabs, swings, and slices with one-to-one precision as you fight for your survival. Dual-wield weapons for devastating combinations, and plan your attacks with the spatial awareness only possible in VR.\n\nInteract dynamically with the world around you - grab and throw objects with real-life movements, react quickly to incoming attacks by blocking and dodging, or use your fists to strike down your voxel-based enemies. The intuitive physics and VR controls take the action to all new heights, making the experience more visceral than ever before.\n\nExplore the madness first hand as you are transported into the heart of action-packed brawls of the Scenarios, the fiercely competitive combat waves of the Arena, and the harrowing depths of the epic rogue-like Beneath.\n\nA host of accessibility options and ways to customise the experience will allow you to make the game perfectly suit your VR setup and maximise your comfort.",
