Left alone and locked you must gather all of your abilities to get out of that space which is full of secrets. You have no one to help you except your own wit. Can you unravel the mysteries, solve the intricate riddles, and successfully make your escape?\n\nOne of the genres for which VR is perfectly suitable is the Escape Room.

Designed for those seeking an extra challenge after completing the main game, the bonus rooms provide a perfect continuation with new and more demanding puzzles.",
