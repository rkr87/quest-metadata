        "description": "Based on ASUâ€™s Mars Space Flight Facility JMARS GIS tool, Planetary Parfait is designed to support a wide range of scientific research tasks, including geologic mapping, feature analysis, and mission planning. The platform includes a variety of tools and features to support these tasks, such as 3D visualization, annotation tools, and data layers that can be overlaid on top of the terrain data. It is intended to be used by researchers and scientists working in fields such as planetary geology, geography, and geophysics, as well as by educators and students interested in learning about planetary science.\n\nFor more information about creating custom terrains, please visit our website: https://meteor.ame.asu.edu/jmars/\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://meteor.ame.asu.edu/projects/jmars-xr/privacypolicy.html ",
