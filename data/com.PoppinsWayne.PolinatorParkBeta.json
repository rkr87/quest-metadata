        "description": "Europe 2050 – Following a cascade of ecological crises, our world has been deprived of healthy ecosystems and wealthy flora. Amidst this dystopian landscape lies a lavish green beacon of hope: Dr. Beatrice Kukac’s Pollinator Park -a futuristic farm, a safe haven for pollinating insects and an eye-opener for its visitors. \n\nPollinator Park is a crossover between a zoo, theme park, an interactive museum and a crystal ball: fun,  educational and emotionally engaging. As a park visitor in 2050, unravel the story of its founder Beatrice Kukac, try your hand at pollination, shop for grocery shopping in a pollinator-deprived world, rediscover nature’s perfection and find out how you can help protect it in the real world.  \n\nThe European Commission's virtual Pollinator Park was built in collaboration with ‘archiobiotect’ Vincent Callebaut, in his signature eco-futuristic style. \n\nStep into this beautiful virtual reality about the ugly future we face without pollinating insects!",
