        "description": "This is a VR live viewer application that allows you to easily check out dance performances by anime-style characters.\nYou can decorate items and enjoy double speed dancing.\nVroid simple load and pass-through functions have also been added.\n※Currently, the application will not start without \"Allow file access\" at startup.\n※Please summon in the playback state, as there is a problem of misalignment during playback if summoned in the stopped state.\n\nIf you have a PC, you can further customize the live performance by loading VRM models, VMD dances, and music files.\n→For detailed instructions, please check the official website or readme.txt in the app's dedicated folder.\n\nThe app is still under development, various updates are planned at irregular intervals.",
