        "description": "- Explore a snowy mountain valley on a hang glider. \n- A relaxing flight through this stunning landscape with frozen lakes and forests. \n- Use boost rings and thermals for a longer flight.\n- Try to find a mysterious crash site.\n\nThree control modes:\n- Hanging: Just like in a real hang glider, use your body to control the flight.\n- Lying: Use the movement of your hands to control the flight.\n- Sitting: Use the combined movements of your body and hands to control the flight.\n\nSafety (Hanging control mode):\n- Do not use open hooks, lateral movements can cause the rig to come loose from the hook, use carabiners instead.\n- Do not use chairs with wheels, a wheel could lock sideways and overturn the chair.\n- Do not use improvised or poorly fixed bars.\n- Wrap the bar with foam and use a mattress below your body.\n- Never use handrails in high places as a bar.\n- It is recommended that you always have someone close to help in any situation.\n\nThis project was developed from the classic Unreal Landscape Mountains Showcase. \nAll credits to the talented team at Epic Games related to the original project. (The original project is available for free at the Unreal Marketplace.)",
