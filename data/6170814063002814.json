With full support for flat, 360, 180, monoscopic and stereoscopic videos, its versatility lets you focus on the creative work, not the technology.\n\nSay goodbye to tedious downloading, sideloading, and taking your headset on and off repeatedly to make notes. Embrace the future of creative collaboration with Screening Room.\n\nCurrently requires an account with Frame.io.\n\nThis application is not affiliated with Frame.io or Adobe.",

You can log out using the settings menu.\n- The player will correctly remember your last selection for the projection type so you don't have to reset it all the time.\n- When switching between controllers and hand tracking, the interface will move backwards and forwards respectively in order to make it a bit more comfortable to use.\n\nBUG FIXES\n- When opening the transport controls using your controllers, it was opening them below the player instead of in front. This has now been fixed!\n\n\nKeep the feedback coming and thank you for your support!\n-Matt (The Developer)"
