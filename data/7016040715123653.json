        "description": "Train Your Mind and Body in VR with Mathletic Duel!\n\nMathletic Duel is a game where you punch targets labeled with numbers to solve mathematical problems and defeat monsters. It's highly effective for improving students' computational skills, combating physical inactivity, and serving as an anti-aging exercise for the brain and body in older adults. \n\nThe game starts with simple, Level 1 problems, allowing players to ease into the challenges. Victory is achieved by correctly answering 10 questions before being defeated by the monsters, which also escalates the level of difficulty. As levels increase, the complexity of the math problems and the number of punches required to input answers also grow. Speed and accuracy in both computational skills and punching technique are essential. \n\nEach response's correctness and time taken are recorded per question, and correct answers earn points. These points are converted into player endurance, so the more problems you solve, the more leeway you get in response time. Even problems that initially seem difficult can be overcome by repeatedly solving lower-level problems, enhancing both endurance and computational skills. \n\nBy the time you clear all problem levels, you'll have gained confidence in your calculation ability and punching technique. \n\nIt's time for a duel!",
