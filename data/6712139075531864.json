        "description": "Welcome to the VR Rage Room for Oculus Quest 2, where you'll embark on a stress-relieving journey through four unique environments: the Living Room, Graffiti Room, Abandoned Office, and Toilet.\n\n**1. Living Room Lash-Out:** Step into a cozy yet destructible living room setting. Channel your frustration as you unleash your rage on everyday objects like vases, lamps, and furniture. Smash, toss, and demolish to your heart's content, all in the comfort of this familiar domestic space.\n\n**2. Graffiti Gallery:** Immerse yourself in an urban art haven turned chaos zone. Armed with virtual weapons, you'll have the opportunity to obliterate graffiti-covered walls, spray cans, and other urban-themed objects. Transform your anger into a work of virtual art as you paint the town red, quite literally!\n\n**3. Abandoned Office Angst:** Venture into a dilapidated, abandoned office space where every object becomes a target for your pent-up frustration. Let your inner office warrior run wild as you pulverize printers, shred paperwork, and wreck computers. It's the perfect setting for cathartically smashing the corporate grind.\n\n**4. Toilet Tantrum:** Even the most unexpected places can be a source of stress relief! Find yourself in a virtual toilet, where you can flush away your anger by breaking bathroom fixtures, smashing toiletries, and causing general restroom mayhem. It's a comically absurd backdrop for your virtual rampage.\n",
