        "description": "Vivid Vision Home is designed by doctors and vision scientists to provide affordable binocular vision treatment. Using the latest therapeutic techniques, vision therapy in VR may help improve eyesight in patients with lazy eye and other conditions. Vivid Vision Home uses challenging video games with anti-suppression, virtual prism, and other binocular vision treatment techniques to help improve acuity (clarity of vision) and depth perception (3D vision). \n\nVivid Vision is only available from an eye care provider, such as an optometrist or ophthalmologist, and is designed to complement in-clinic therapy. Your eye care provider will customize your settings and how often to re-evaluate your condition in a clinic. \n\nReady? \n\nFor Vivid Vision Home, you will need the activation code provided by your eye care provider and a virtual reality headset.\n\nFind out how to get your prescription from a Vivid Vision provider by visiting our website:\n\nhttps://www.seevividly.com/doctor_locator",
