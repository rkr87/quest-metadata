Unlike others, where you can simply jump in and play, Skydive Sim offers a true-to-life experience that mirrors the challenges and thrills of real-world skydiving.\n\nMastering Skydive Sim requires understanding its intricate control mechanics, much like learning to skydive in reality. Take your time to explore our comprehensive tutorial scene and utilize our extensive collection of online tutorial videos. These resources are designed to guide you through mastering the controls and enjoying the exhilarating experience of Skydive Sim to the fullest.\n\nSkydive Sim offers a range of activities. Free fall movements, tracking jumps, base jumps, and canopy physics presets with the option to set your own custom canopy! Canopy malfunctions with cutaway and reserve, front riser inputs, swooping and now even jet packs! With jet packs you can take off vertically and work on your canopy landings again and again without having to restart the level. Best of all you can experience all of it with friends from around the world, using our global multiplayer mode.\n\nhttps://www.skydivesim.com\n\n",
