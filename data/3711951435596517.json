        "description": "*****In this latest 2.0 version of SkydiveSim, we are thrilled to introduce the much-anticipated cutaway and reserve functionalities. Responding to the enthusiastic requests from the skydiving community, we've included these features to enhance the training and entertainment experience. Now, skydivers and enthusiasts can practice handling cutaways and deploying reserves in a relaxed virtual environment.\n\nOne of the most exciting upcoming features is the introduction of canopy malfunctions. This addition will be a game-changer for training, as students can now visualize and identify malfunctions in a controlled environment. By simulating canopy malfunctions, users can learn to stay calm and make the right decisions under the canopy, contributing to a safer and more prepared skydiving community.*****\n\nSkydiveSim brings the thrill of skydiving and BASE jumping to your Oculus Quest headset. No more waiting on weather on bad weather days. Put on your headset and choose from our gorgeous levels. Jump from a plane 10,000 feet above ground. Challenge yourself to go through the free fall rings. Then pull your ripcord and fly under the canopy and finally work on your accuracy and  land on the target. You don't need a plane ride back up, just repeat in the same scene or choose another one of our exotics environments to jump into.\nWant even more  excitement? BASE jump from top of the buildings, windmills and light towers, pull the ripcord and navigate to the ground!",
