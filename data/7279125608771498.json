        "description": "GET A TASTE OF DOES IT STACK?\n- 5 levels / 15 challenges, ranging from easy to genuinely evil\n- 25 unique objects to play with\n\nTo unlock the remaining 15 levels consisting of 45 challenges, the Does It Stack? - Full Stack content pack should be purchased.\n\n--- Why should you play Does It Stack? ---\n\nCREATE RIDICULOUS TOWERS\n\nTackle carefully put-together stacking challenges, using the available items creatively. Can you build a tower of toy cars with a bicycle on top? Can you balance a fish on a bowling ball? This is the time to put your fork in the toaster! Get inventive and explore different solutions!\n\n\nTHERE IS A CATCH!\n\nBut watch out. If two objects of the same color touch each other, they go BOOM! Be careful, or you might get a heart-a-stack.\n\n\nSTACKING CHALLENGES\n\nThe stacking challenges get increasingly more absurd, harder, and higher. At some point, you might need a ladder. Ladder not included.\n\n\nFUN FOR EVERYONE\n\nDoes It Stack? sets you up for some funny situations. We do the setup, you perform the punchline.\n\n\nSANDBOX STACKING MODE\n\nObjects you use in the challenges are unlocked in a sandbox mode. Here, you have all the time in the world to create stacking masterpieces (or disasterpieces). Get inventive, build absurd towers, build incredibly high towers, or just play around with objects. The choice is yours! We offer creative replayability â€” there's always a higher stack!",

This includes:\n\n- Default: the colors you all know and love.\n- IBM, Tol, and Wong: color sets that should help people with color vision deficiency.\n- Cyberfunk: a neon color set that gets you into the stacking groove.\n- Pastel: for those who see stacking as a lazy Sunday afternoon pastime.\n- Xmas: some seasonal tints to get you ready for sleigh bells and too much prosecco.\n- Oops: also known as HARD MODE. Everything is purple, so you can't really tell which objects are gonna explode. For those who think the game's too easy!\n\n\nChristmas Special\n\nThere's a temporary extra level for you to beat! For every challenge, you're getting a unique Christmas-related object. Free up some space next to the Christmas tree and make a jolly stack!"
