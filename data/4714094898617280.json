Many of them also said that they’d preferred to have all the songs unlocked from the beginning because they wanted to enjoy their favourite songs right away. After thinking about what could be the best to address this feedback we decided to change the way we use the in-game challenges. From this new update on, we won’t hold any music content from the user. You will be able to play any song in the set list from minute 1. However, in order to grow as a rockstar and play in bigger and better audiences you will still have to complete a few challenges per album. We hope this decision will help you enjoy the game to the fullest and be the rockstar you always wanted to be.\n\nPatch notes:\n\n- All songs are unlocked at start.\n- Venue selector: now players can select the venue they want to play on.\n- Players will unlock venues when they complete album challenges. \n- Album challenges redesigned according to user feedback.\n- Difficulty balanced according to user feedback. It’s harder to die in easier levels.\n- Improved upstrumming: Now is easier to upstrum.\n- Reduced the percentage of success notes played to achieve a golden record.\n- Balanced guitar Fans price.\n- Volume raised in some songs.\n- Minor bug fixes.\n"
