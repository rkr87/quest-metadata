        "description": "Become fish with friends!\n\nSwim around - \nFish Game uses it's own unique hand based locomotion to make the fishy experience on top.\n\nPlay mini games - \nThere are a few different mini games to play on the different maps, a few honourable mentions are the two originals Swords and Boats.\nIn Swords you have 3 lives, you must hit the other fish until you're the last one standing.\nIn Boats angry fishermen are trying to catch you with their evil fishing net!\n\nChat with friends - \nJoin public rooms and chat with new fish, maybe you'll even find a new friend!\nIf you aren't in the mood to talk with new fish, you can always make a private room and send the code to your friends.\n\nThere's a lot more to do - \nYou can play the Sandbox mode where you can make your own creations.\nYou can customise yourself by changing your name, colour and maybe even put on a nice hat to finish off your look.",
