This means you'll have a more immersive and enjoyable experience as you explore your surroundings. You’ll notice zones, enemies, and interactable objects now consider the guardian when looking for free space. Zones can now appear on top of beds, tables, couches if set up manually. Anything interactable will now also consider your height, they will try not to be placed above your eye level.\n• [Quest 3] We've made sure that encounter spawning avoids potential interference with objects detected during your room scan. This makes your Mythic Realms adventure even smoother and more worry-free.\n• We've spruced up your passthrough experience with improved environmental visuals. This will make transitioning between the real and virtual worlds feel more seamless and engaging.\n\nKingdom Improvements\n• Shadows in the kingdom are now enabled.\n\nUser Interface Improvements\n• The personal screen dock now has depth enabled buttons, making it much easier to see when you tap them.\n\nBug Fixes\n• There was an issue when the device went to sleep that would cause objects to shift when resumed, now on resume this is refreshed with data from the new session.\n• Some of the user interface, animations, and interactions could break when timescale changed (personal menu opening), these now will use unscaled time to allow for them to work correctly.\n• Other smaller fixes and improvements"
