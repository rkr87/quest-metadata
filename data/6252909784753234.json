        "description": "Hunt is the only VR game that can drive and hunt at the same time! Hunt 2.0 added one more Volcanic Island to double the play content and grabbable gun and bow support.\n\nAfter dinosaurs were revived, they occupied a remote island and enslaved many other animals. In order to control the dinosaurs, human beings need to research their eggs. To aid their cause, you will go to the dinosaur island and collect these eggs. This is an extremely dangerous quest, and you will face attacks from terrifying dinosaurs and colony animals. This game has twenty four thrilling levels.\n \nKey Features: \n\n- Use Meta Quest Touch controllers  to control the racer and four different cars through the river and island.\n\n-  Fight with all kinds of ferocious dinosaurs and colony animals face to face in a full-featured vehicle.\n\n- Use eco-friendly air cannon to defend yourself and powerful air swirl device to collect eggs.\n\n- Use Bow and Gun to defend yourself.

Dinosaur attacks may occur at any time.\n\n- Optimized smooth viewing angles to help you avoid the dizziness of traditional VR car games.\n\n- The X button on the left hand controller can give you menu help at any time.",
