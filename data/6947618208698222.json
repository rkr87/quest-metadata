        "description": "A simple drone “trainer” I made to save a drone or two. It provides an environment to get a grasp on how to fly a drone without crashing into the ground, ending the event in less than a minute.\n\nUnlimited retries with a $2 app vs a $20 Test drone, that could have one use, your choice.\n\nThe “game” is very basic with hopes of developing a sense of finesse to real flying controls, and isn’t supposed to be a die-hard drone sim. More of a “practicing at the parking lot before hitting the main roads” type of game. What you see is what you get but I made the dang game, and can add in something later on. \n\nPlay in three styles; Direct view of the drone itself, through the screen on the controller, or through the Head Mounted Display which can be used to learn the basics of First Person View flying.\n\nNotable Features:\n\nPassthrough! If you want to fly within your home, then tap the underside of your player’s Right Wrist to switch over.\n\nHMD/FPV! There’s an option to place a “headset” on for true fpv view; press the left trigger to switch modes and it’s a ‘button’ under the “WARNING HMD” mode layout.\n\nThere’s a “Camera” mode to help practice for beauty shots that need flight coordination at an odd angle; or angle the camera up for a First Person View feel!\n\nDual-rate (think of control sensitivity) is enabled to max to make sure new flyers can get used to the input, turning it off gives MUCH sharper input; becoming overall more acrobatic.\n\nIf there's a want to have a regular RC plane type, then shout out.",
