        "description": "Arcaxer is a turn based VR RPG with first person action oriented combat, and a 3rd person god-view overworld set in a sci-fi simulation filled with colorful AI characters.\n\nIn the overworld you will explore procedural dungeons to find equips and new abilities for your character. You can access the hub world to interact with NPC's and buy new items with the credits that you earn in the dungeon.\n\nEven though combat is turn based you must dodge enemy attacks with your body, and aim and time your own attacks with gestures. Can you make it to the top of \"The Stack\"?\n\nPlayer Classes Choose fighter, thief, or mage to drastically change which abilities you learn as you level up your character.\n\nFighter: A class with a focus on physical attacks\nMage: A class with a focus on Hax, the game's special abilities.\nThief: A class with wildcard abilities that can change the tide of battle.\n",
