        "description": "In the seaside village of Otsuchi, Japan, Itaru Sasaki built the Phone of the Wind as a way to enable contact with those who are no longer with us.\n\nThe Phone Of The Wind looks like any other phone booth. However, this phone is physically connected to nowhere.\n\nThe natural tranquility and transcendent means of communication combine for a unique and cathartic healing experience.\n\nIn this Interactive Film, experience the real life stories of three phone users grieving for their loved ones, then enter the Phone of the Wind and experience it for yourself.",
