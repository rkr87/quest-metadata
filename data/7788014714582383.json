        "description": "This is a gorilla tag fangame, it is a mix of Capuchin and Gorilla Tag, but instead of there being the generic monsters, there are nextbots! Right now the game is in its early stages of development. So do not expect much until the game is at its full release. This is just an alpha version for now. So you do not have access to everything just yet! Until then, play this game with you're friends and have fun!\n\nI want to clarify something about the trailer really quick, this was made by my friend. NOT ME, and the trailer is the old representation of the game, I will be adding the same features. Just not yet because this is an early version. So please do not hate the game just because the trailer is older! Thanks!\n\nQuick note: Horror has been restarted, so in the pictures where there is the pool map and garage. That isn't there anymore but is going to be recreated to a better version! So, stay tuned!",
