        "description": "This is a VR (Virtual reality) maze game for Android mobile phone, where you should collect treasures while several creatures (Mummy, spider,...) try to catch and disturb you in a dark pyramid. You will find traps in the maze as well so it won't be an easy job for you to collect all the treasure and leave the maze. The maze, it's size, the traps and monsters' locations are random, so you will be able to play the game in many variations. ",
