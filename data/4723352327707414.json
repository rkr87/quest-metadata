We‚Äôve carefully gone over the whole game to take greater advantage of the Quest‚Äôs hardware capabilities and improve the overall player experience based on your feedback.\n\n**Update 10 improvements include:**\n‚ú® Bloom and HDR\nüíØ 100s of New Visual Effects\nüî´ Horizontal Weapon Recoil\nüêÇ Final Boss Revamp\n‚ö° No more insta-death on Void Glitch \nü•û Unstuck Button\nüêû Improved Bug Reporting tool üòÇ\nüí™ Dozens of bug fixes and performance improvements\n\nThis update includes a full-fledged visual overhaul (with incredible results), long-requested improvements to the early game, a reworked weapon recoil system and a whole bunch of quality of life bug fixes.\n\n**New Features and Improvements:**\n\n- New Graphic Options supporting Post-Processing Effects and increased render scale\n- Custom graphic settings on PC\n- New Bloom Intensity and Effects Intensity sliders. Bloom Intensity controls the baseline \"static\" bloom strength. Effects Intensity adjusts the visual 'strength' of explosions and any other animated or dynamic effects.\n- Reworked visual assets to support bloom glow effects\n- Improved texture quality\n- Improved look of sewers area\n- Improved visuals of Lunatic end sequence and win screen (space flight scene with credits)\n- Polished particle and material animation assets (bullets, shot reactions, smoke effects, explosions, sparks and numerous other details)\n- Added material animations to all explosions\n- New bullets and hit/impact particles for player and most enemies\n- New enemy particles (Bulky Melee Bot, Security Bots, Final Boss)\n- New muzzle flashes for shotguns, revolver and grenade launchers\n- Improved performance for all particle effects (should result in more particle systems being shown at the same time on Quest 1/2)\n- Lowered polycount on all enemies and weapons without loss in visual quality (should result in better performance)\n- Reworked part of the industrial tileset and props (lower polycount, cleaner geometry/outlines, added more glow elements)\n- Fixed texture bleed on endless walls and lowered their polycount\n- Lowered polycount of skyscrapers and fixed some wrong materials on them\n- Added glow elements to room connectors and lowered their polycount\n- Added horizontal weapon recoil and balanced all weapons\n- Players are now reset if they fall out of the map. This should hopefully fix a large source of frustrations.\n- New \"Unstuck\" button in pause menu, which will reset you to the start of the level\n- Improved chip and weapon tooltips in homebase\n- Extra visual indicator for undiscovered chips\n- Increased Render Scale to 1.35 on default settings for Quest 2\n- Boss fight improved by fixing broken attack phases, balancing cooldowns, improving visuals contrast and various smaller visual improvements.\n- Boss fight rocket attacks are easier to read now (rockets were extremely small before)\n- New Holster Settings Menu, unifying previously disparate options. Minor cleanups of other smaller inconsistencies. Does anyone use the horizontal offset setting?\n- Improved pump shotgun to prevent pumping when fully loaded, but still allow pumping if the secondary hand trigger is held.\n- Improved the description of various weapons\n- Adjusted blaster chip explosions (less harsh now)\n- Adjusted revolver muzzle flash to avoid blocking sight lines\n- Improved readability of holo map with bloom active\n- Toned down glow of class hands\n- Balanced bloom on several environment assets\n- Performance improvements of certain rooms\n- Adjusted menu text outlines\n- Improved logging and bug reporting system\n- Improved and updated Credit screens with new team members\n- Improved Lunatic end sequence\n- Improved and fixed some decoration assets\n\n**Bug Fixes:**\n\n- Fixed list of chips in home base\n- Security bots no longer run out of ammo with certain weapons after one magazine (Grenade Launcher, Burst Handgun, Heavy Submachine Gun)\n- Fixed error when destroying an EMP'd turret\n- Fixed some chips (Speed Boost II/III, Overload, Overheating) not spawning in levels and unlocking properly when picked up\n- Fixed interaction of Blaster Chip with other chips that change bullet types (Firepower, Heavy Ammo, Acid, Mobile Malware)\n- Fixed already defeated (and exploded) turrets \"respawning\" inactive when revisiting a room\n- Fixed missing particles when shooting decoration assets (prefab link was missing)\n- Fixed inconsistent player bullet impact behavior (handgun bullets had 30 times the force than shotgun/sniper/other bullets)\n- Fixed wrong materials on drones\n- Fixed weak points on scanner bot, bulky melee bot and all drone variants\n- Fixed weak points (explosive tank on back) not being removed after being hit for all guardian and drill bot variants\n- Fixed damage multiplicators on gunner bot and spider bot soldiers\n- Fixed wrong weapon on improved grenade launcher bot (spawned with Shotgun)\n- Fixed wrong weapon on improved burst shotgun bot (spawned with Precision Shotgun)\n- Fixed healing ray of drones (had high impact force that could potentially bounce around other enemies when hit - still has problems with aiming though)\n- Fixed door animation (some door types would still stick out of walls on one side after opening)\n- Fixed a number of null reference exception errors that had adverse side effects\n- Fixed various typos and text layout issues\n- Fixed crash on startup due to bluetooth permission changes in latest Android version\n- Fixed some edge cases when glitching out of the map\n- Fixed issue with burst shotgun bot\n- Boss fight: fixed drone mouth attack (drones often were immediately killed after being spawned)\n- Boss fight: removed overseer laser attack (was completely broken)\n- Boss fight: fixed collider for mouth (was gigantic - is now sized to fit the mouth weapon)"
