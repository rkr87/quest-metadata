        "description": "Reveal the clues, defuse the traps, clear your tabletop!\n\nTable Trouble is a mixed reality reimagining of the classic mine puzzle. Either by manually creating game fields on the fly, or by using the furniture defined in your room, you can create playable areas in your space and solve puzzles quickly.\n\nEach game is procedurally created with your choice of slab sizes and trap to field ratio. With the simplistic, down to basics game and UI interaction, you can play sessions that take only a few minutes whenever you like.\n\nTable Trouble allows you to switch between controllers and hand interaction seamlessly through the game, providing a versatile game interaction. Whether you create a field manually, or turn a furniture of your choice into a bottomless pit with the game field, you can play seated, standing, with both hands, single hand, both controllers, a single controller, or, if you like with hand tracking on one hand, and controller in the other.\n\nYou can use your hands intuitively over the clear parts of your table, and switch to your controllers where you have to play from a distance.\n\nTable trouble utilises advanced optimisation techniques to draw hundreds of tiles in your space to replicate the decades old game mechanics in mixed reality content. Release slabs, watch them trickle down into the well that opens up in your furniture and enjoy quick sessions whenever you're on your headset and need a few minutes break with a familiar gameplay with a spatial twist.",
