Set in the far future, 'Formation' features a unique core-gameplay experience that focusses on intense formation flying. \n\nTHE BULLSHARKS\n\nDecades ago, war ravaged the planet. Driven back in to the sea, the forces of the Allied Planetary Defence were facing defeat. In a last-ditch effort one of the few remaining air units — the Bullsharks — almost singlehandedly turned the tide of war.\n\nFor those too young to remember the war, the 7th serve a new purpose. In an age of peace, the once deadly machines of a century-old conflict now serve to inspire budding engineers, scientists and pilots as they thunder through the skies above Ocea.\n\nWELCOME, PILOT\n\nNow that you're up to speed on the backstory, let's discuss this year's mission schedule. Truth be told, 'Air Command' is a little worried about some of the planned formation routines because of how risky they are. Ocea's mayor isn't too happy either!\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to get your head around the FORMHUD system which will keep you synchronized with your squad. Commander Burns himself is expecting you for basic flight training at 0600 hours.\n\nJOIN THE FORMATION TODAY!\n",
