        "description": "Haunted House is a fun and action driven game at it's best when played with a friend. You have to defend yourself against the hordes of undead cardboard monsters sneaking up to you from all sides. Shoot orbs to take them down but make sure you don't run out of ammo before the game ends. You can play Haunted House alone and try to last as long as possible with only a limited amount of ammo and a constantly growing number of monsters emerging from the dark of the night. But you can also have a friend control the cutout creatures and find out whether your reflexes or his strategy can claim the victory. To play toghether simply have your friend download the free Haunted House Puppetmaster smartphone app from the Google Playstore and pair your devices via Bluetooth or join the same local network. You can get the free Haunted House Puppetmaster App here: http://headroom.one/hauntedhouse-pm Short games combined with intense gameplay make this a great game for in-between!",
