        "description": "Swivel is a VR ride through outer space that's jam-packed with music, movement, and excitement.\n\nIn this first-of-its-kind outer space experience, you swivel your way down a cosmic track straight to the dance floor. \n\nWhile you’re swiveling, get ready for a hands-on party - drumming, popping bubbles, opening doors, high-fiving aliens, and collecting music notes.\n\nThe beats? Crafted by the legendary Barry Leitch, these tunes groove with the story and your every move. There are 8 tracks, each with its own style, and the first ride, 'Fly,' is on the house – your sneak peek into the game's vibe:\n- Fly - pop (free)\n- Love me and leave me- 50s soul\n- Sweet tooth - pop dance\n- Sputnik - dubstep\n- Spin - light metal\n- Winter - classical\n- Wally Beben - retro\n- Ennio Morricone - western\n\nSome rides are swivel-heavy, so be prepared for some serious spinning action. And guess what? There are also secret paths to up the fun factor!\n\n– Important note –\nPlease take your time easing into the game. After a few days of play, our bodies adjust, and spinning becomes incredibly enjoyable – it's like tapping into our inner child. \n\n– Seated game with a minimum play space of 6.5 feet by 6.5 feet –\nSwivel is a seated game that involves turning and making cool moves. Ensure you have at least 3.3ft (1m) of space in all directions.\n\nWe recommend using a ‘swivel’ chair to make those tricky turns a blast!\n",
