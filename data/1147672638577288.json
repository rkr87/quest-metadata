        "description": "Do you like to draw? How about animate? Now you can do both while surrounded by a 360 degree view of your art. Circumpaint allows you to paint with pixels on a hemispherical canvas with you at the center. And when you're ready you can move beyond stills using page flip style animation. Uses the touchpad, or use a gamepad to access shortcuts.\n\n\"I ended up animating a pixel dragon breathing fire, it was silly but cute. It made me laugh and want to play a bit more. The developer clearly understand the limitations of trying to paint with your head, I appreciate the choices that they made to deliver a surprisingly satisfactory experience.\"\n-- Brad Herman, Head of DreamLab at DreamWorks Animation\n",
