        "description": "Tactera is a Real-Time Strategy game played on a “virtual tabletop”. It is the winner of the Casual Connect Indie Prize, winner of a Proto Award, and was a Mobile VR Jam Finalist.\n\nInside a futuristic war room, a 3D hologram shows two armies on the verge of battle. You are the tactical mastermind who must command your troops to victory. Build swarms of gunships, tanks, bombers, and other units, and use your hi-tech view of the battlefield to strategically outmaneuver the enemy!\n\n“Tactera is a wonderful tactical game that is easy to learn and challenging to master. 9/10” - Mobile VR Daily\n\n“Tactera is different, not only because it’s simplified real time strategy, not only because it automates a lot of the more mediocre parts of the genre, not only because it’s a faster paced tactical game, but because it’s designed for Virtual Reality from the ground up.” - VR Perception\n\nIf you like Tactera, you should also check out Darknet and Skylight, from the same developer!",
