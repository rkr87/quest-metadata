        "description": "Winner of the Grand Jury Prize for Best VR Work at the 78th Venice International Film Festival and nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Interactive Media Innovation category.\n\nThrough mind-bending animation, GOLIATH: PLAYING WITH REALITY explores the limits of reality and a true story of so-called ‘schizophrenia’ and the power of gaming communities. Echo (Tilda Swinton) guides you through the many realities of Goliath, a man who spent years isolated in psychiatric institutions but finds connection in multiplayer games. Combining heartfelt dialogue, mesmerising visuals and symbolic interactions, weave through multiple worlds to uncover Goliath’s poignant story. \n\nCreated by the award-winning creative studio Anagram.\n\n*Please note, you will be required to use your microphone during this experience. \n\n**For users who have trouble leaving the room in the sequences on the arcade machine, please use the thumb-stick to move out the door. The door is not visible when seated.",
