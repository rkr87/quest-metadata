        "description": "\"Birds of Prey\" would have been the political thriller of Abel Ferrara’s dreams…until it all fell apart. The neo-noir, provocative director behind movies like \"Ms. 45\" (1981) and \"Bad Lieutenant\" (1992), takes us with him on a journey through the heart of the 70's New York City.\n\nMISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films.  Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made. \n\nA series directed by Clément Deneux from an original idea by Joseph Beauregard.\n\nCoproduced by Atlas V, ARTE France, BBC, PTS, Serendipity Films, Wild Fang Films, Giioii.\n\nWith the support from CNC, Pictanovo, Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Procirep-Angoa, TAICCA, Film Fund Luxembourg, RAPA and Ministry of Science and ICT (Republic of Korea).",
