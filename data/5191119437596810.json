        "description": "SynergyXR gives users a DIY XR toolbox that lets them easily create their own VR meeting space and add a wide range of interactive content like 3D models, pdf documents, images, and even videos.  \n\nUsers can interact with the content manager to drop content anywhere in the space. Users can also resize, place and interact with content, including playing videos and writing on virtual whiteboards. Even better, you can step inside 3D models to get a fully immersive experience.​  \n\nSynergyXR is free to download and try out the tutorial.
