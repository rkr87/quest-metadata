We have also added more hats and gun buddies .\n* Multiple tweaks to the Tutorial have been made:\n   * We have added a little extra to the tutorial intro to give some more lore as to what you are doing and why.\n   * Previously we locked the rotation settings to only \"Drag Rotation\" during the tutorial, and allowed more options later after the tutorial. This was to encourage players to use our new (better) system. We have now allowed all rotation options form the very start. Enjoy!\n   * We have removed the 'skip tutorial' option the very first time a new player starts the game, when the tutorial starts automatically. This is because we noticed that a lot of players skipped the tutorial, got frustrated by not knowing the controls in the game, and quit. We understand you guys wanting to get into the action as fast as possible, but please take the 5 minutes to figure the controls out first .\n* We've added functionality to skip the splash screens at the start of the game. Just press any button!\n* We have added our discord code so that more people will be able to join our discord and game together.\n* Made the Mini Bosses more SCARY! They now rumble the ground, shaking your mech and your soul in anticipation!\n\nMajor fixes:\n* We have added some more colliders to still allow you guys to climb and explore, but not soft-lock yourselves. This is for your own protection .\n\nMinor fixes:\n* Applied several balancing tweaks.\n* Some upgrade descriptions had variables that were not filled correctly. This should now be the case.\n* Some posters in the ending scene have been corrected to the correct ones, go check them out (if you can).\n* Some errors were not localized, this should now no longer be the case.\n* Fixed an issue with the Flyer Boss stinger colors not changing as part of the phase changes.\n* There was an issue with the first hit on enemies not updating their healthbar correctly, displaying it as full. This should no longer be the case, and show the correct amount immediately.\n* We have adjusted our haptics system to allow more settings for playstation and other platforms.\n* We fixed an issue where the music would occasionally desync with the action. This should now no longer happen.\n* Previously the Dash indicator light only communicated the cooldown. Now, it also takes fuel into account, as you cannot dash without fuel, so this is now more accurate."

This should now work even if we remove and add items from the Cosmetics menu.\nWe have fixed issues with the “Explode on Impact” and “Boobytrap” Grenade Launcher upgrades: these should now be much easier to use.\nWe have resolved issues with the “Life Drain” and “Vampiric Damage” permanent upgrades! These should now FOR SURE work as indented:\nLife Drain should have a 50% chance of triggering and give a small amount of HP back.\nVampiric Damage should have a 100% chance of triggering and give a slightly larger amount of HP back, but you also take more damage from enemy attacks.\n\nCHANGES\nWe have added much more sounds in the hangar and in -game, so keep an ear out!\nQueen makes sounds when changing phases.\nHangar buttons now make sounds consistently\nEquipping weapons, cosmetics and upgrades now make some noise!\nThe mechs in the victory scene now make some noise!\nYou will get a unique noise after picking an upgrade in-game depending on their rarity.\nThe Slicer and Droughtwave upgrades now have SFX!\nYou now get a sound when being invited to join a game and receive a friend request!\nWe added a sound to our error pop-up, but hopefully you won’t hear that one a lot :wink:.\nWe have added a new screen to the mech stats panel! You can now see a list of all upgrades you have acquired throughout your Run!\nWe have improved stability across the board (We realize this is vague but it’s just code refactoring and guard clauses: most actual fixes were contained in the previous Hotfix patch.)\nPurchasing an item while having an empty equipment slot equipped now automatically equips that item.\nWe have added lights to the mech’s headlights in the Hangar!\nBugparts now no longer get collected if your tank is full, giving your partner a chance to pick more up!\nNow that Life Drain and Vampiric Damage have been fixed, we’ve tuned their numbers a bit:\nLife Drain has a 50% chance to convert 3% of damage done to mech health. (aka: for each 1000 damage you deal you should heal 15 hp.)\nVampiric damage has 100% chance to convert 10% of damage done to mech health. (aka: for each 1000 damage you deal, you deal 900 damage and heal 100 health.) BUT also enemies do double damage to you. (NOTE: This is meant to give a “safe” and “unsafe” option, one that supports a little bit constantly, and one with high risk-reward.)\nMade it possible to shoot through fences in maps that have fences.\nThe Grenade Launcher has been buffed from 160 to 210 (Note: We received feedback that the Grenade Launcher was quite underpowered compared to the Flak, especially after a few good upgrades. This should make the damage more reliable; from two grenades barely killing a 300hp Grunt to two grenades for sure killing a 300hp Grunt and heavily damaging the ones around it):\nGrenade direct hit damage has been uptuned from 60 to 80.\nGrenade AOE damage has been uptuned from 100 to 130.\n\nMINOR FIXES\nWe have fixed issues with our enemy navigation, which was causing enemies to get stuck in place.\nWe fixed an issue when equipping the “Empty” item: this should now be much easier to use.\nWe have implemented various smaller UI fixes:\nThe microphone icons have gotten an update.\nFixed the Spewer boss missing SFX for their laser attack.\nFixed wall visuals in The Abyss\nFixed an issue with the slicer upgrades no showing particles correctly.\nDrastically reduced the the “Immune” text spam when hitting bosses with weapons like Laser and Flamethrower.\nFixed some surplus text in subtitles.\nDowntuned the particles related to Lifesteal upgrades (they should now accurately convey the amount gained)\nWe have fixed some floor colliders having the wrong mask causing loot to fall through floors (Tangled Nest).\nRemoved a surplus spawn point in The Yard which causing players to spawn outside of the map."

(This is additionally to also having to succeed an “Arch” check to see if the projectile would reach).\n\nImproved Grunt attacks: They will no longer get stuck outside of attack range when they are close by and can’t attack.\n\nLocomotion\nThe Jetpack now uses less fuel, making it easier to remain afloat and reach some of the higher platforms. (Note: We realized not a lot of players were using the jetpack, so with this tweak we hope to make the overall jetpack experience more forgiving and rewarding).\n\nQuality-of-Life\nWe have added a Recalibrate Button! You are now able to use the in-game menu to recenter yourself in the Mech and the Hangar! (Note: This is only available on the Steam version).\n\nYou can find it immediately in the Mech Menu when in a run, or under “Settings → Gameplay Settings → Recalibrate” in the Hangar.\n\nWe have added a Seated Disclaimer to the start of the game. (Note: we saw a lot of content creators standing up in their footage. Everyone is allowed to play standing, but hopefully this will make it more clear that BIG SHOTS is designed as a seated experience).\n\nMajor fixes\nGame Stability Improvements! We have made dozens of changes that should result in a more stable experience and less issues overall, mostly focused on waves not starting or ending, as well as transitioning between levels.\n\nLosing Upgrades: We have found and solved many issues that may cause players to lose upgrades during a run. That sucks! While we are confident that we have resolved the majority of causes, some edge cases may remain, so make sure to get in touch if this occurs again!\n\nEndless Loading Screens: Fixed various instances of internal errors causing the loading screen to never disable\n\nFixed an issue with the Fire Rate + Upgrades: some combinations caused fire rate to reset, causing you to not have the full benefit of all upgrades. This should no longer be the case.\n\nFixed an issue where Highroll would reset your damage to a lower default value after the effect expired. This should no longer be the case.\n\nFixed an issue where “Healing” permanent upgrades (Vampiric and Lifesteal) in certain scenarios would result in the player losing health instead of gaining health. This should no longer be the case.\n\nMinor fixes\nThe Jetpack handle texture was improved!\n\nCorrected fireworks sounds in the victory celebration level.\n\nIncreased font size of the “Searching for Room” screen.\n\nFixed the Queen’s corpse not despawning in the victory celebration level.\n\nFixed a Vine being untextured in “The Portal” level.\n\nFixed spawnpoints in some levels that caused Bosses to appear inside of walls."
