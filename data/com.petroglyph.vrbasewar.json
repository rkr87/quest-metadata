Construct your base, build your army, and determine your strategy of attack. Every map provides a unique challenge with new units, obstacles, and traps to contend with. You can even advance your economy to earn the right to build the fearsome nuclear silo and rain molten destruction on your enemy! As you level up your character, you’ll earn cash for technology advancements that can be placed into your own custom maps to share with other players. \n\nOther features include, an in-game tutorial, leaderboards, map editor, and the classic base-building, economy management, and strategic battles that strategy players love to dig into.",
