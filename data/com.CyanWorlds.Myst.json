        "description": "Welcome to Myst: a starkly beautiful island, eerily tinged with mystery and shrouded in intrigue.\n\nJourney to Myst Island and other stunning, long dormant locations - called “Ages”- and begin to unravel the mystery you have been thrust into. As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself.\n\nCyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst.\n\nBuilt from the ground up to play in VR, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated Myst VR experience has arrived!\n\nUPDATE: April 4th, 2023: Please note that due to newer Meta software updates preventing the support of new features for Quest 1 moving forward, and our desire to make sure Myst supports the latest and greatest software & hardware, we must cease Quest 1 support in Myst on October 1st, 2023.
