        "description": "**WARNING:** This game must be played by at least 2 people. One player is immersed in VR, while his or her partner must have in hand the Support File (available at https://novascience.github.io/VR/), which contains a wealth of information. Good communication is essential to progress in the game.\n\n\n**Biology : Mission : Protein**\n\nWe need you to cure a patient who has a genetic disease. Your intracellular mission is to synthesize a protein, which will let you put your knowledge into practice to prepare for your exam!\n\n\n**Chemistry – Mission : Molecule**\n\nYou are invited to board a time/space/digital teleportation machine to solve puzzles about the structure of the molecules involved in three ecological disasters. This trip will give you the chance to review concepts related to molecular geometry, types of hybridization and chemical bonds.\n\n\n**Physics – Mission : Dark matter**\n\nYou have to send your pilot to the space station to get information about several stars. In exchange, NASA will give you information on five stars from the galaxy UGC 11748, a galaxy we have strong reason to believe contains dark matter. To succeed, you will have to combine your knowledge of the conservation of energy and the dynamics of circular motion.",
