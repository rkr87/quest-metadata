Fixed an issue where using a winch with an unlimited angle could cause a gameplay blocker.\n\n4. Fixed an issue where the player could accidentally engage the reverse gear.\n\n5. Increased the steering wheel speed for 200° and 450° profiles.\n\n6. Changed the position for the winch tree in Mission 5.\n\n7. Reduced the sound for falling stones during MIssion 5.\n\n8. Reduced the amplitude of downward movement of the automatic gate opening lever, for your comfort.\n\n9. Improved the intense moments in the soundtrack.\n\n10. Reduced the duration of the ship’s signals in Mission 10.\n\n11. Various stability improvements.\n\n12. Various visual and gameplay improvements.\n\nThank you for playing MudRunner VR! \n"
