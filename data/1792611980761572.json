        "description": "Tired after a long day of hiking, two best friends Kendra and Jen are on a lookout for a place to stay for the night. On the advice of a passing driver, the girls end up in a cosy looking guest house located deep in the woods. It's not long after they had settled in their room that strange, unexplainable events begin to happen. The girls soon realize that a dark secret was hidden deep within the walls of the house...\n\nThe Eerie Inn is a mystery, puzzle-solving horror game. You play as one of the girls and your mission is to find out the truth behind the mysterious things happening inside the guest house.\n\nDetailed graphics coupled with great suspenseful music creates an intense horror VR experience unlike any other. \n\nWe strongly recommend standing up while playing and having your headphones on for greater immersion.",
