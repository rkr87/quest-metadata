Therefore, we have replaced these voices with new ones, ensuring the conversation experience remains as seamless as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience.\nDaily Free Energy:\n     Users without a monthly plan can collect 30 free energy daily by checking in.\nEnergy Usage:\n    Once gifted energy is used up, the system will automatically use your Coins (same as before).\nNo Changes to Coin Purchases:\n    The method for purchasing Coins (Energy) remains unchanged."
