        "description": "FindingVR is a first person action/adventure game designed exactly for VR. Imagine that you are no longer a person who control the Hero from a top-down view, you are the Hero himself!\nPlayers could solve puzzles using their intelligence and control skills. The joy of game is based on the adventures as the player explore in the virtual world and the sense of achievements when mission completed. We believe that the intense boss battle will make the player excited.\nYour mission is to find out what happened to this world, and how to save this world. Also, you need to defeat those enemies who stand in front of you, find out the right way in the dungeon, and defeat the final boss of each chapter to move on to the next stage.\nYou can use both touchpad and gamepad to play this exciting, deep ,VR game. This might be the most challenging game you can play by using only touchpad in Gear VR ever.",
