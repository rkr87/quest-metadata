        "description": "A lightning-fast action VR platformer in which the enemy always outnumbers you, and the cost of a mistake is death.\n\nSlice your way through a utopian city, shredding heavily armed opponents with a deadly katana in a stylish super-fast manner. \n\nHone your skills with each kill. Find hidden ways to complete each level and get a higher score with a medal! \n\nBETA CONTENT\n\nRight now, there is one available realm with multiple levels and regular enemies.   \n\nPLANNED CONTENT\n\nIt is planned that the game will contain various realms of an alternative Japan, and the player will be able to fight their way through all of them, from the feudal era to the futuristic shiny skyscrapers. All the realms are connected by core gameplay mechanics and a narrative.\n\nEach realm will contain:\n⭘ An interactive city map\n⭘ A unique boss\n⭘ 20 platforming levels with side quests, puzzles, and a wide range of challenges for all types of players.\n\nAs the game progresses and the player gains experience, new realms with stronger opponents and a more complicated level design will become available. Also, the game will change visually, narrative- and gameplay-wise in each realm.\n\nThe further you progress through the game, the more interactive elements inside your mansion will become available - practice throwing shurikens, play with a cat, have Sushi, learn the art of calligraphy, and much more! Many different physics-based mini-games will be available to you in addition to the main gameplay",
