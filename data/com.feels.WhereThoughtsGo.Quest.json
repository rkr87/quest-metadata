        "description": "Discover the dreams, fears and secrets of othersâ€”and leave your own for others to find.\n\nIn this award-winning social experience, human thoughts exist as sleeping creatures that can be awakened to reveal voice-recorded stories of other participants who were here before you. These anonymous stories are revealing and inspiring, encouraging reflection and introspection. To progress, you must leave your own stories behind for others to uncover\n\nVisually beautiful and wholly transformative, Where Thoughts Go thematically explores the course of a lifetime through five simple questions written to dig deep. The voice recordings you hear are unique and unidentifiable, left by individuals from every walk of life, every age and every background. Participants have no way to discern who they are hearing from, only how considerate and sensitive each and every person is. \n\nThis project is under development. Join our Community at http://WhereThoughtsGo.Me/Community and be part of the process!",
