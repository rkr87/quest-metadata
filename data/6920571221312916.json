Interact naturally with patients with customizable avatars to feel like you’re meeting in-person. Meet in VR for immersive telehealth in a tranquil and comfortable virtual clinic room. Use realistic 3D stimuli as part of your evidence-based care.\n\nPatients need only download Doxy.me VR and enter their provider’s room code.\n\nProviders claim their room code for free on doxy.me: https://help.doxy.me/en/articles/8891403-doxy-me-virtual-reality\n\nDoxy.me VR is part of our goal to make telehealth for everyone. This ongoing project is actively under development with support from the National Institute of Mental Health, Lucid Reality Labs, and practicing telehealth professionals. Doxy.me VR is designed to be used under the supervision of a practicing healthcare professional and is not intended to diagnose or treat medical conditions.\n\nQuestions, comments, concerns, ideas?
