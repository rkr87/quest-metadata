        "description": "**Welcome to Glider Sim: Your Ultimate VR Soaring Experience!**\n\nChoose from the Hang Glider, Paraglider, Paramotor, Mini-Wing, Speed-Wing, and even a Racing Drone! \n\nFly across 3 large open-world maps that include:\n\n- Sun Valley, USA\n- Walenstadt, Switzerland (Swiss Alps)\n- Grand Teton, USA\n\nEach map, spanning approximately 50 kmÂ², is crafted from real-world satellite imagery and enhanced with high-resolution textures and lush vegetation. Choose from hundreds of launch points on each map.\n\n\n**Dynamic Weather System:** Customize your flying conditions with adjustable wind direction and strength, as well as time of day. The sun angle and terrain dynamically influence thermal activity and cloud formation. Toggle wind particles on or off to visualize thermals and ridge lift! \n\n\n**Flight Physics:** Experience the precision of true-to-life flight mechanics. Each cell of your glider is simulated with soft-body physics, allowing for maneuvers like wingovers, spirals, stalls, and swoops. Stay vigilant to prevent your paraglider from collapsing mid-flight!\n\n\n**Challenges:** Test your skills with Scored Challenges on each map. Compete in Speed Flying challenges, Cross Country (XC) Races, and more. Monthly leaderboards let you see how you stack up against pilots worldwide.\n\n\n**Single Player / Multiplayer:** Enjoy solo flights in Single Player mode or join friends and other pilots in Multiplayer mode. Connect with our community on Discord to organize flights and participate in multiplayer competitions!",
