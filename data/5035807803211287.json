        "description": "Welcome to Glider Sim, a professional paragliding/paramotor simulator aimed at achieving the realism of the actual sport! Ride thermals up to the clouds alongside soaring eagles, or rush down steep cliffs in the speed wing. Jump into multiplayer and experience the sensation of free flight with your friends! \n \nThe sim contains 3 of the biggest open world maps ever created for the Meta Quest: Sun Valley, ID, USA; Walenstadt Switzerland (Swiss Alps) and the Grand Teton Mountains, USA. Scenery is derived from real world satellite imagery and overlaid with high resolution textures and dense vegetation. Each map is approx. 50 km2. \n\nAttention went into flight physics, wind and thermal systems. Choose your launch point, glider, and weather condition. Use your VR controllers to grab the handles and lean forward to takeoff! Find ridge lift and thermals to stay airborne. You can toggle on and off wind visualization particles. Use the in-game Map/GPS to track your flight across the map.\n\nEach cell of the glider is simulated and physics applied. You can do maneuvers such as wingovers, spirals, stalls, and swoops. Watch out and don't let your wing collapse!\n\nFly the scored challenges that help improve your flying and understand the basics of paragliding. \n\nBe sure to share and rate if you enjoy so we can continue development!\n\n(Important Note: Quest 1 users will no longer receive updates and Quest 1 multiplayer will no longer work after Jan 1, 2024)",
