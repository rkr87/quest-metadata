        "description": "Bite the Bullet is an virtual reality action/strategy game where YOU command troops alongside them on the battlefield! Build and defense your basecamp, summon units to fight directly from the battlefield, and wipe your opponent from the map!\n\nSpawn self-sufficient soldiers, tanks, helicopter gunships and bombers, all from your wrist! Your troops will mercilessly hunt the enemy, but will need reinforcements to triumph! You can even pick up a weapon yourself in a crisis to pitch in!\n\nAs the number of basecamps you control grow, your choices in what buildings to construct directly influences the type of army you can field! Just don't forget to build defensive turrets, against both ground threats and those from the sky!",
