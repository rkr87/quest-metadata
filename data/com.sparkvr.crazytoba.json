        "description": "In the beginning at the creation of the world, the old gods preyed on the weaker ones invoking the law of the jungle, threatening the other creatures of the universe. Then the god of discipline, having been ordered to inspire some of the human civilization, established the sanctuary and cultivated guards to defend the noble Light. The other creatures came under the influence of the old gods, who created a savage civilization, to confront the human beings. The North Goblin, taking advantage of the situation, attacked the city and looted its resources. Your responsibility is to guard the noble Light using your wisdom and strength.\n\"Defenders of the Realm VR\" is a tower defense game; players need to act as a lone hero in the game to guard the sanctuary. There is no escape route, and you only have cold traps to accompany you, and your only objective is to kill, using these traps to kill all your enemies.",
