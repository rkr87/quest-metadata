Use the new bHaptics option on the main menu to pair the hardware with the Quest. You'll need to allow TotF permission to access Bluetooth (shown as location permissions).\n* Added support for Quest mixed reality capture.\n* Added multiplier reset button to the Configuration quick-view panel to the right of the main menu. This button will only appear when you have the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" enabled, and will let you quickly reset your multiplier if you feel it is stuck too low or if you are handing off the headset to another player.\n* When the AI is lightly dizzed, it will only throw with its typical punch output when cornered. Previously, the AI would change from its lower punch output when significantly dizzy directly to its high punch output from being cornered. Switching to normal punch output under light dizziness helps the transition between the two."
