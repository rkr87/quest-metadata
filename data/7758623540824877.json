        "description": "Beat Labs is an open and cross-platform sandbox for rhythm games in Virtual and Mixed Reality (VR/XR). Itâ€™s powered by a database of over 100 000 community-made song beatmaps.\n\nBeat Labs aims to provide **a platform for immersive experiences** rather than being a single game. A platform for music and rhythm-based mini-games, powered by content created by us, **the community of players** and AI (Artificial Intelligence).\n\nOne of the biggest selling points of Beat Labs is the **sheer number and variety of songs** the players can choose from. There's tens of thousands of beatmaps (levels) created by the community that we tap into.\n\nBeat Labs is **highly customizable** to cater to various players preferences. This includes the ability to choose the type of gameplay, an environment in which the game takes place, custom models of weapons and destructible objects and more.\n\nThe customizations described above are part of what makes Beat Labs an **extensible platform**. The content that the community creates may even introduce novel gameplay mechanics that we haven't yet thought of. This approach is similar to other, highly popular and profitable platforms, like Fortnite, Minecraft or Roblox.",
