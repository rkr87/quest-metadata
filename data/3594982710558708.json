This value was not properly updated, and the live patch continued with the lower requirement. Recognizing that players have already been experiencing the current requirement for a significant amount of time, we acknowledge that suddenly increasing the 3 star crafting requirement to a significantly higher value would feel discouraging. To find a reasonable compromise, we have decided to raise the crafting requirement for 3 star crafting to 80 crafts. We believe this adjustment strikes a balance that acknowledges the progress made by players while still maintaining a challenging goal for mastery attainment.\n- Updated the Skyland crafting mastery bonuses to provide 10%/20%/30% crafting cost reduction for one star, two star and three star crafting respectively, up from 5%/10%/15%.\n  + Developer Note: We recently addressed an issue that unintentionally resulted in a 50% crafting mastery benefit at rank 3. However, in our efforts to rectify the issue, we inadvertently over-compensated by decreasing the three star bonus down 15%. We understand that this adjustment made the crafting mastery bonuses feel underwhelming. To ensure that crafting mastery remains impactful, we will be implementing an increase to the bonuses, increasing them to 10%, 20%, and 30% for ranks 1-3 respectively, aiming to restore the sense of significance and reward in crafting mastery.\n\n\nFor full Major 1.3.0 Release Notes, see: https://zenithmmo.com/blogs/news/patch-1-3-notes-skyward-summit \n\nGo to: zenithmmo.com \nNews and Blog \nPatch 1.3 Notes: Skyward Summit"
