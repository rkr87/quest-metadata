We hope you enjoyed the Holiday event but it was time to put up the Christmas decorations, disable the hologram trees and get back to business!\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n* Reduced Bomber Imp damage\n* Improved UI and description of the private room code entry (Note: Come up with a code and share it with your friends.  Everyone will need to type it in to join together.  It’s more reliable than Friends and Invites! )\n* Updated the credits to include more of our play-testers and music composers\n* Increased the amount of fireballs a fireball staff can shoot per gem\n* Boss enemies can no longer be frozen.   That said, hitting a boss with an ice staff or ice weapon will still do damage.\n* Rebalanced OP crossbow damage with the reload perk.  Each Reload Perk tier reduces 7.5% damage per bolt/shot.  They are still very powerful, but it brings the damage down a bit to be reasonable.\n* Reduced Elite Bat and Spider health.  I think we can all agree the bats were OP and annoying.\n* Added a cooldown before a player can get refrozen again\n* Improved cosmetic loot chests so that if you have collected all cosmetics, you will either get a random weapon drop instead, or sometimes a “All Cosmetics have been unlocked!” message\n\n\n\nFixes\n\n* FIXED: Can’t load “Please wait.. loading game” issue some people were experiencing.\n* FIXED: Dungeon Raids that never started the end combat encounter\n* FIXED: Navmesh issues in some dungeon chambers which cause enemy pathing issues, or teleport issues\n* FIXED: Missing terrain in one of the dungeon chambers for a specific biome\n* FIXED: Various dungeon chamber visual and technical issues\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* With the new Quest OS v60 update, Quest Battery Saver mode will make the game run at 72 fps resulting in non-optimal visuals, physics and player experience ( vs the game’s default 80 fps experience).   Additionally, on the Quest 3, Battery Saver mode disables Enhanced Visuals.\n\n"
