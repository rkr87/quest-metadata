        "description": "# NEW MIXED REALITY DEMO!\n\nBEST TECHNOLOGY AWARD🏆 XRC: NEXT REALITY CONTEST 🏆\n\nFrom the Studio Scientists at Curvature Games Revolutionizing VR locomotion and the muddled minds behind the Cult VR hit Elevator... To The Moon!\n\nComes a greatly expanded 20 min (Or more if you can't work it out) Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Walking Simulator (with real walking) sci-fi educational film, existential crisis, hybrid puzzler.\n\nEnjoy having your mind blown (metaphorically of course) as you travel in and out of mixed and virtual reality in a quest, on a quest for a greater purpose.\n\nOur Love letter to GameCity Hamburg and the XR community.\n\n❤️ Curvature Games\n\n🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴🚶‍♂️🔴\n\n# IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CLEVER PEOPLE\n\nPlease ensure you have a 2X2 meter room scale playspace before starting. If the scene goes dark it means you have put your head inside a wall - normally impossible without hurting yourself - or have left the designated play area (naughty).\n\n**Please note: this is a a proof-of-concept for a larger VR game** \n\nIt is, what they call in the industry a vertical slice (not to be be confused with a powerful fencing technique or interesting pizza cutting specialty) \n\nWe are releasing it to you in a “playable” state and you may encounter some bugs along the way. However you could also just be stuck. Our only hint is you use your head to complete the experience, or better yet… someone else's.\n",
