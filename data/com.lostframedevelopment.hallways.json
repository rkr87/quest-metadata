        "description": "Hallways is a spine-chilling mixed reality game like no other! In \"Hallways\" you'll face a relentless attacker in the heart of your own play space. As the clock ticks down to dawn, you'll need to use strategy through your limited power supply to keep the enemy at bay and survive till morning.\n\nInspired by the most immersive survival horror experiences, \"Hallways\" uses your real-world surroundings as part of the game. Set up multiple \"hallways\" within your play space, strategically placing them to complete tasks and use light switches to control the hallway lights.\n\nUse your hearing and electric power to detect the enemy's approach. When you identify the hallway under threat, flick the light switch to reveal the lurking danger. If you catch a glimpse of the enemy down the hall, it will retreat, only to resurface in a new, random hallway. \n\nHallways is packed with features such as:\n● Next Gen Mixed Reality putting your room into the game\n● Non-Linear Gameplay: never the same game twice\n● Immersive Audio: Spatial audio and sound effects immerse you in the atmosphere.\n● Strategy: Find the best way to survive the night\n\nCan you keep the nightmare at bay and make it through the night? Face your fears and find out in \"Hallways\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",
