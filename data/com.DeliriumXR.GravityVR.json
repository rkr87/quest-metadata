        "description": "THE STORY\nGravity VR drops you in a surreal world where everything perpetually falls. But there's no vertigo or fear, only a unique sensation of floating in zero gravity.\n\nIn this captivating VR story, you'll encounter two elderly brothers who lead a surprisingly ordinary and peaceful life amidst the chaos. Until one day...\n\nExperience their emotional journey firsthand and discover what awaits them at the bottom. \n\nDISCLAIMER:\nGravity VR is not a game. The experience is 15 minutes in duration and focuses on storytelling rather than gameplay.\n\nDIRECTORS:\nGravity VR is the first virtual reality project of Amir Admoni and Fabito Rychter. Their creative partnership has produced a range of acclaimed movies, TV shows, and plays, which have garnered 71 international awards and been featured at over 120 festivals around the world. \n\nCREATOR´S COMMENT\nWhile falling is often a common nightmare for many people, one of the intriguing aspects of creating Gravity VR was approaching this sensation not as something frightening, but ordinary. \n\nGravity´s reach surpassed our wildest dreams. The experience was showcased at Tribeca, Cannes, Venice, among other prestigious festivals. \n\nGravity´s success brought us a range of unexpected opportunities that ultimately led to the production of our second VR experience: Lavrynthos.\n\nTHEMES:\n-Loneliness and isolation\n-Polarization, lack of dialogue,  irreconcilable differences\n-Mortality and coping with death\n",
