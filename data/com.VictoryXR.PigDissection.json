        "description": "VictoryXR’s virtual reality pig dissection software is a hands-on dissection opportunity experienced through the power of VR. This true-to-life, hour-and-a-half practice thoroughly covers each step of the science procedure that students would take if dissecting a fetal pig specimen in their classroom.\n\nThe entire program adheres to the Next Gen Science Standards (NGSS), America’s framework for science learning. In addition, we’ve implemented the processes and procedures of Carolina Biological--America’s leading supplier of science education materials. Using original and lifelike physical models, the dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail and is a comparable substitute for actual live specimen classroom dissections, without the safety and ethical implications. Schools save on expensive and rising annual costs of animal specimens. Additionally, acquisitions are reliable and not dependent on animal procurement.",
