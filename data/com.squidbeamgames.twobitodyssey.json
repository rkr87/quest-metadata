But he is not alone. He sees you. You are his guide. When he asks for direction, look around and find a location for him to explore. When he finds a button, nod your head in agreement to activate it. Need to see what lurks in the dark? Activate the Twobit Vision and see the world through his eyes. But who is Twobit and, most importantly, who are you? Are you a figment of his imagination?\n\nTwobit Odyssey is an unique VR puzzle-platform game based on the award-nominated game Twobit.\n\nFeatures:\n- Eight mind-bending levels, fours different environments and bosses.\n- Unique control system.\n- Designed to prevent motion sickness.\n- Immersive 3D sound.",
