        "description": "A snowy world with floating numbers and pleasant sounds. In the center of the world, there is an iceberg with a number engraved on it.\nYour goal is to turn the number into \"1\" by hitting the iceberg with the floating numbers. When you turn the numbers into “1”, you’ll find the music that you played with the numbers...\n\nThe rules of this world:\nNumbers from 2 to 30 float in the space, and numbers over 30 disappear.\nIf you shoot the iceberg with a divisible number, the iceberg will become smaller and smaller.\nIf you grab the floating numbers in both hands and bring them closer, the numbers will be added.\nIf you grab the divisible number of the floating number and shoot it, the number will be divided.\nTry to make the number on the iceberg \"1\" within the time limit of 5 minutes.\nCan you find the hidden relationship between numbers and sounds in this world?\n\nThe first VR work by Wonderfy, an EdTech company that has won numerous awards for its digital content in mathematics and art.\n",
