Now, the host in a multiplayer match has the option to share their media with the party. \nPlease be aware that this feature is in early access, so we’re still ironing out some flaws! We’re currently aware of some issues, like: \n- If an ad plays before a video, the video will be out-of-sync until the host changes the video\n- Some text may clip out of buttons in certain languages\n- When the host leaves a party *after* turning off media sharing, the remaining party members may experience issues turning on media share. This issue doesn’t occur if the host doesn’t turn off media sharing before leaving the party. \n \nSUPPORT\n🎯 Found a bug, or experiencing an issue? Reach out to our team at help.forevrgames.com!"
