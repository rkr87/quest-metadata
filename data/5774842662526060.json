        "description": "Recent info:\n- v.18 Released!\n- Price change is incoming with the v.20 update!!\n\nFloating GunShip puts you into the gunner seat, rain unstoppable destruction with an array of weapons! Use the TV Guided Missile to 'laser lock-on' for 'fire and forget' capabilities! Obliterate tanks with 105mm armor-piercing penetrators for that satisfying 'one hit cook'! Hammer down with the 40mm, and while the best for versatility, it doesn't compare to the raw firepower of the 25mm Gatling Cannon! \n\nTiming is everything - plan your attacks meticulously to evade incoming missiles. Deploy flares at just the right moment to outsmart your enemies. But beware, ammunition is limited, including your life-saving flares!\n\nDesigned for seated play, providing an immersive and intense gameplay. Settle into a chair with armrests, look straight ahead, tilt your head slightly up, and press and hold the re-center button to align yourself to the console.\n\nThis is an active development project that intends to be as fun as possible; all by a solo developer, me! I have created a RoadMap that will shows what's to come, including when prices changes will happen. It will also show how much of my promise I fulfilled! There's regular posts to the official youtube channel and the sidequest store page, which will contain more information and said RoadMap\n\n\nNote: While optimized for Quest 2, the game should run fine on Quest 1 as well. Feedback helps me enhance gameplay for all.",
