The experience transports you to a magical universe where you can discover new life forms that use the energy from your music to grow, multiply, move around and thrive. You can take photos of the artificial wildlife you discover amongst the mesmerising vistas, and share with friends.\n\nRecording Audio.\nThe app requires permission to record ambient audio in order to function. For your privacy and peace of mind, this ambient sound information is immediately discarded milliseconds after it is read and the app does not not store, transmit or reproduce ambient audio information to deliver this experience.\n\n",
