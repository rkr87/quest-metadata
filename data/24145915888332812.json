        "description": "You won’t believe what’s going on inside British factory farms. In taking this Face Off challenge, you’ll be joining Viva!'s founder and director, Juliet Gellatley, as she exposes the stark reality of factory farming. \n\nMost of what you’ll see is standard practice. These are not rogue operators or ‘bad apples’, they are Red Tractor assured facilities, showcasing some of the ‘best animal welfare standards in the world’. Viva! has 30 years' experience, going undercover and with each farm our team has investigated, we’ve found suffering, abuse and neglect in every corner. \n\nOnce you see the truth, there’s no going back. In recent years there’s been an explosion in plant-based alternatives that makes going vegan easier than ever. Be part of the change. Every time you shop, you have the power to choose kindness over cruelty. The power is truly in your wallet.  \n\nYou can go kind, go vegan! ",
