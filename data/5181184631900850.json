        "description": "Hello everyone, my name is Cao Yong, and I am the main creator of this project. I am very sorry to tell you that Due to multiple factors, the company decided to suspend operations of this company, I will leave the company after updating the second map at the end of April. The subsequent change is that this application will change to a paid model after the second map is updated, and it is uncertain whether the third map will be updated. Thank you all for your support and I hope you enjoy the app.\n\nCamping is a highly popular outdoor activity, but for various reasons, many people are unable to easily experience the joy of camping. Now, simply put on a VR headset, and you can immerse yourself in the pleasure of camping anytime, anywhere, relax your mind, enjoy leisure time to the fullest, and experience wondrous adventures that are hard to come by in reality. This meditative-like experience is expected to bring inner tranquility.\n\nFeel free to join our developer community and collaborate with us to enhance the application experience. Your feedback is invaluable to us!   https://discord.gg/kfb2NATEfS\n\nIt is an honor that \"Mindset Camping\" has been nominated for:\n1. VR Awards 2023 Best VR Experience\n2. FIVARS 2023 International Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Story Festival",
