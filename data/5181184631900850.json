        "description": "Make camping easy for everyone! Hello everyone, thank you very much for waiting for the past six months. During this period, we have also received many inquiries. When will other maps be updated? Today we finally bring some good news, our second map: \"Beach Map\" is finally online! I hope you will enjoy this beach camping trip and continue to enjoy it and find inner peace. Thank you again for your patience!\n\nCamping is a highly popular outdoor activity, but for various reasons, many people are unable to easily experience the joy of camping. Now, simply put on a VR headset, and you can immerse yourself in the pleasure of camping anytime, anywhere, relax your mind, enjoy leisure time to the fullest, and experience wondrous adventures that are hard to come by in reality. This meditative-like experience is expected to bring inner tranquility.\n\nFeel free to join our developer community and collaborate with us to enhance the application experience. Your feedback is invaluable to us!   https://discord.gg/kfb2NATEfS\n\nIt is an honor that \"Mindset Camping\" has been nominated for:\n1. VR Awards 2023 Best VR Experience\n2. FIVARS 2023 International Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Story Festival",
