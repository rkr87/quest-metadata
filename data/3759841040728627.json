        "description": "IONIA™ is an hour-long single-player interactive story for all ages. Get up close with music-inspired creatures in a lush forest teeming with life. Discover music-based magic on your quest to save the Harpa, a mythical creature whose habitat is on the brink of destruction. Every purchase will benefit real-world wildlife, with 5% of proceeds going directly to the Steve & Terri Irwin Foundation, Wildlife Warriors Worldwide.\n\nThe Harpa is the heart of the Ionian forest. With every tree felled by the approaching Tritone army, her spirit weakens. You and your sister Allegra are Ionia’s brave new heroes, embarking on a quest to heal this mythical creature with the power of music before it’s too late. \n\nInspired by music mythology, Ionia is a fantasy world brimming with interactive plant and animal life. Find food for glowing Ocarinas, see breathtaking vistas, climb vines in the canopy of ancient trees, and discover the depths of a watery cave. \n\n",
