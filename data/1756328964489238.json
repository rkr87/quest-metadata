With hand tracking v2, we're excited to have even higher quality hand tracking for your Tai Chi experience.\n\nCLEARER VISUALS \nQuest 1 and Quest 2 are surprisingly different hardware. One update we've made is to increase the visual fidelity for Quest 2 users, by removing fixed foveated rendering. This will remove any peripheral blurriness and increase immersion.\n\nUI REFINEMENTS\nWe've refined how the UI cursor appears and displays throughout menu systems. This small change feels really nice.\n\nIMPROVED CONTROLLER SWAPPING SUPPORT\nThe old version had a few odd behaviors when switching dominant hand or switching from controllers to hands. We've fixed these. You can now swap back and forth, from primary hand or control method without any quirks.\n\nTEACHERS FACE FORWARD OPTION\nDue to a few conflicting options, Teachers Face Forward would sometimes not work as intended which was frustrating. The Teachers Face Forward option will now always work correctly in gameplay.\n\n---\n\nFUTURE ENHANCEMENTS\nWhile we've been silent for a bit, we have some fun (100% free) updates coming in 2022. We hope you enjoy! :)\n\n---\n\nFIND A BUG? HAVE AN IDEA? NEED A FRIEND?\nSend messages in a bottle our way at gtc@cubicleninjas.com. We'd love to hear from you!"
