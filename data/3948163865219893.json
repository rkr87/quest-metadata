Start your disc golfing adventure learning how to play with the friendly AI-controlled DiscBot!\n\nThe best part of disc golf? Playing with your friends of course. Enjoy all playable courses with lobby-based private and public matchmaking (yes, even this demo is multiplayer!).\n\nBoth experienced disc golfers and newcomers alike will appreciate our realistic disc physics. Each disc has its own rating using a 4-number rating system that will be familiar to disc golf enthusiasts, but easy for newcomers to learn.\n\nThroughout the course of the game you will earn Chain Link points to unlock new discs. Customize the collection that you want to take with you on your next round.\n\nWith multiple beautiful courses with varying biomes you may find yourself stopping to just enjoy the scenery.

Teleport is now more resilient to failure to further prevent this from happening.\n- Fixed the “mulligan bug” where you could move out of and back into your shot area while the disc was in flight to be able to re-open your bag and take a shot from the same place you just took a shot from\n- Fixed some cases where your shot area could visually appear in a tree when moving around the course manually\n- Fixed bug where sometimes the “Go To Shot” button would not appear (particularly if you were moving around outside your shot area while your shot was happening)\n- Fixed bug where sometimes the throw power difficulty you picked in settings was not “sticking” before entering a match\n- Since the previous update there are now some Par 5 holes in the game - because of this, we added the ability to get an Albatross (3 under Par). This is also now tracked on the stats page in the menus\n- Removed Random Objects (say goodbye to the great red arrow)\n- Fixed typo for multiplayer map names\n- Hilly Forest is now displayed as an “easy” course\n- Updated sun tint on brisky and hilly forest.\n- Fixed UV and scaling issues with tee pads\n- Updated map 5 signpost images on a few incorrectly displayed boundary lines.\n- Removed ‘labels’ from the power meter that is displayed while the disc is flying.

The usage of AI characters will be expanded upon in future game content and this is our first example of that. The tutorial is required to play through once and will automatically start when you load the game. It’s 5-10 minutes long. If you want, you can skip playing the game on mount pound at the end of the tutorial, it will still count as completed once you have loaded the map once (but you will of course miss the pointers that pop up at each hole).\n- Some minor graphical improvements: some shading on the hands, reflectivity on metal objects like the baskets, trash cans, etc\n- Basket chain racks have been updated to be a brighter more attractive yellow\n- UI update: we have changed our UI’s overall “branding”. All styling was updated for the menus both in-game and on the main menu. This is still a work in progress and we’re happy to receive feedback on this.\n- If you aren’t looking at your watch for a couple seconds it will now automatically close\n- You can now see the reverse side of water if you’re underneath it on Quest.\n- On PC, we’ve switched to the same water shader that we’re using on Quest for a big performance boost and to unify the look of different versions of the game. We have on the list to do some additional water updates in the future that both PC and Quest will receive.\n- “Next Tee” signs have been added to all of the maps so it’s easy to tell what direction the next hole is if you’re walking manually.\n"

It is suggested to test out these settings before starting a game. \n- New power meter attached to the FollowCam will show you the expected power range for each disc and where you fell within that range for each shot.\n- New home menu map that better fits the theme of the game. This will eventually also be used as the home for some new mini games, the interactive tutorial, and multiplayer lobby.\n- Replaced menu hover over sound with haptic feedback (vibration) instead\n- Feature removal: you can no longer see discs behind terrain. Some assumed this was a bug rather than a feature - in either case, it is removed.\n- Old video tutorials have been removed - these were heavily outdated and will be replaced by an upcoming interactive tutorial.\n- When in free mode the FollowCam will disappear promptly any time that you open your bag to take another shot\n- Fixed alignment of loading screen for main menu screen\n- For the Quest private beta we have added the 6th course for internal testing, Inway Hills Park\n"

For multiplayer, this correctly adjusted location will be used in the calculation for “who goes next” (should solve inconsistencies in turn order for multiplayer with OOB shots).\n- Disabled disc auto grab while the menu is open (so that you don’t accidentally grab and drop a disc when using the laser pointer to interact with the menu).\n- Fixed bug where the disc info UI and auto-grab function would stop working during gameplay (often would happen when doing a fast-teleport while your bag is already open in front of you)\n- Fixed bug that only happened on certain courses in which if you had both highlighted the go to shot button with the laser while also using the fast go to shot controller button it would teleport you twice (once half way through the spinner, and another when the spinner had completed)"

If a disc is highlighted, you don’t need to be near it to grab it - simply pressing the trigger/grab button will bring it to your hand.
