        "description": "You're being chased by the enemy and have to escape.\nFight their drones, turrets and vehicles on a train through several levels and several waves.\n\nYou can choose between the Story or the Wave Mode. In Story Mode, you have to go through multiple level after another and defeat the end bosses in each level.\n\nIn the Wave Mode, you encounter waves of enemies and during a pause, you can buy new weapons.\n\nUse different types of weapons to deal as much as damage with the least amount of bullets. \nYou can pick between a pistol, a shotgun, a machine gun and a grenade launcher.\n\nDodge their attacks during the bullet time.\nThe bullet time activates as soon as a enemy bullet gets close, dodge it by physically moving in the room while the time is slowed down.",
