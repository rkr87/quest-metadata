        "description": "Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand.\n\nThis game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m.\n\nTRAVERSE A VAST ENVIRONMENT:\nEye of the Temple makes unique use of room-scale VR to deliver an experience of navigating an expansive space. Lose yourself in the depths of the temple without teleportation, artificial locomotion, or other distractions.\n\nUSE A FULLY PHYSICALLY SIMULATED WHIP:\nWield your whip to grab levers and defend yourself from threats. Before long, you’ll have mastered it as a reliable tool and effective weapon. \n\nAN EXPERIENCE PLAYED WITH YOUR OWN BODY:\nStep onto blocks, flick levers, and dodge obstacles. You’ll play this physical game not with controller buttons, but your body, and it’s designed to be easily approachable regardless of whether you normally play video games.\n\nUNLOCKABLE SPEEDRUN CHALLENGES:\nIf you’re an extra daring adventurer, you can unlock speedrun challenges where you can build up incredible speed for a true test of your temple-running prowess.\n\nPlease note!\nYou may get a sensation of almost losing your balance when blocks you stand on start or stop moving, and there is a small risk of falling over. This will usually quickly decrease over time. The game also has various VR comfort options.\n",
