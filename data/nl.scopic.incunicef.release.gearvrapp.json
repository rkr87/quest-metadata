        "description": "Adolescence is that crucial time when a person goes from being largely dependent on family and society to personal empowerment, when a person is able to take on new roles and make an important contribution to his or her own health and well-being and that of those around them. Evidence shows that when adolescent girls and boys are supported and encouraged by caring adults, backed up by policies and services that are attentive to their needs and capabilities, they have the potential to break through long-standing cycles of poverty, discrimination, and violence.\n\nING and UNICEF empower adolescents by focusing on skill-building and providing them with opportunities to create social change.\n\nThe Power for Youth partnership supports projects in Nepal, Zambia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kosovo and Montenegro.",
