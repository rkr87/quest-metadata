        "description": "Arena Jam is a free-to-play hero shooter that has a transformative impact the player.\n\nBecoming the ultimate champion is more than just your fighting skills and your ability to talk trash. It is the mindset and emotional control of a true champion that defines you as a legend in the arena and in life.\n\nArena Jam is a virtual martial art that takes the fun and excitement of your favorite fast-paced shooter and combines it with the lessons and mindfulness of your favorite meditation app.\n\nThe arena is our dojo, a place to fight each other, learn from each other, and get the best out of each other.\n\nFeatures:\nStart as the Powerful Soldier Class. With 6 abilities and an ultimate, you’ll be more jacked than your favorite 80’s action hero!\n\nAre You Not Entertained? The arena never gets old with 5 different game modes to play including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, Free For All, and 5v5 MOBA.\n\nDid we mention MOBA? That's right. We're talking 5v5, towers, minions, jungle monsters, buffs, and store items. You will MOBA in your pants from all the LOLing!\n\nDon’t have friends yet? Neither do we. So we made some friend bots and some bots to kick the snot out of.\n\nUnlock more characters. You can buy two more at the same price of a cup of coffee at your favorite corporate coffee shop. Caution: Contents are hot!\n\nBe mindful in combat. In the Warrior Reset, reflect on that hard-earned victory. Or, convert a loss to a learning experience to help you build the mindset of a champion.",
