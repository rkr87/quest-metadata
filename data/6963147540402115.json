        "description": "If you experience claustrophobia in real life, stay away from this immersive VR Horror title: Tunnels.\nAn expert, the best fit for this daunting adventure, starts as sealing an abandoned mine once and for all but once he discovers what he signed for was far more than this assignment from Henry’s company, the journey of Jim in those mining shafts takes an ominous turn. While navigating through those suffocatingly dark tunnels, a fading radio connection is the only interaction Jim has with the outside world. However, Henry’s voiceover that radio is not the sole companion for him. \nA sinister lurks in those abyssal, claustrophobic tunnels and narrow passages. For Jim, the realization comes too late; the main quest for him, unfortunately, quickly turns into getting himself to safety as soon as possible. For us players, though, escaping from this VR experience’s haunting moments will prove to be far more challenging than Jim's harrowing task.\n\nAs we continue to grow the game and the story of \"Tunnels,\" we also invite you to join our multiplayer mode to test your wits and those of your friends!",
