Be sure to update and make sure you're on v0.1.827, as displayed in the top-center of the main menu.\n\nIMPORTANT CHANGES TO COMFORT SETTINGS:\nYou spoke, and we listened. The height of our flow settings under 'Comfort' has now been slightly lowered universally. You will likely need to re-adjust your settings to find which newly updated setting works best for you. \n\nThis also means that the new 'Low' setting is now closer to your waist than it has ever been; the new 'Medium' setting is equal to our previous 'Low' setting; and the new 'High' setting is now closer to the old 'Medium' setting. Listen to your body and find which newly updated combination of settings best suits your needs!\n\nSome other STARWAVE improvements you may notice:\n- Space environments have been improved in various areas for richer color vibrance and variety.\n - We've smoothed out some of the visual effects on stardust trails. Be sure to keep those wands moving and swirl beyond the trails for some freestyle fun!\n - First time users will now be given a new set of fan-favorite levels on their first Daily Voyage.\n - Moon Phase bonuses have been adjusted to clarify your bonus rewards. Don't miss playing on days with Full/New/Quarter Moons on the real-world calendar for extra points after your Daily Voyage!\n - The Tutorial has been improved for legibility.  \n- Stargazer Mode has also been updated after player feedback for a more accessible way to watch constellations come to life from a seated position.\n\nBeyond these updates, we've also been prepping some underlying technology necessary for us to soon provide optional new galaxies to the expanding STARWAVE universe! Look for more news on that soon. ;)\n\nLook to the skies and be sure to join our Official STARWAVE Community on Facebook or our Discord to join the conversation, meet other voyagers, and connect directly with the dev team to have your voices heard.\n\nSTARWAVE Discord: https://discord.com/invite/rRXuJp9m6n \nSTARWAVE Community on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/playstarwave\n\nThanks to everyone for voyaging with us so far. We can't wait to see where we all go together on the voyage ahead!\n\n -Team STARWAVE\n"
