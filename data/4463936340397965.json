        "description": "You awake from cryo in a mysterious museum. A robot refers to you as a curator and the security system is malfunctioning. Can you get things back to normal and escape? You'll need to solve puzzles that include drone navigation, crafting, rewiring circuits, climbing, physically navigating mazes, match 3, and dancing. Some puzzles will have you moving in and out of AR and VR within the game itself. There are five areas including a \"boss level\" that contains the largest variety of puzzles. The intro and end game credits are both interactive.\n\nThere are no jump scares. The game is designed from the ground up for roomscale VR on the Quest, but supports all locomotion modes. Most objects can be interacted with, it fully uses physics, and the hands don't \"ghost out.\"\n\nNote: This game is currently in early access. It is fully playable and fun, with around 4-5 hours of play time. A price of $14.99 is planned for the finished game.\n\nJoin our discord: https://discord.gg/2NfBumhKQD",
