        "description": "PozeAR is an Augmented Reality martial arts training app.\n\nWe record the movements of real experts performing real moves using optical motion capture, then let you step into their shoes and learn pozes from your own perspective.\n\nFOR STUDENTS\n\nGet motivated with a scoring system, difficulty levels, and achievement medals.\n\nPrepare for each move using step-by-step yellow guides showing hand forms, body rotation, leg heights and more.\n\nAim each move using the red target. The front of the target changes to show the type of strike you should use.\n\nFollow fast movements with the help of motion trails.\n\nHear your instructor provide step-by-step audio instructions.\n\nTwo virtual, lifesize 3D instructors are in-front and behind you at all times, performing the moves.\n\nFit your body by adjusting height, arm lengths, leg lengths and more.\n\nAnalyse your performance by watching a lifesize 3D replay of your actual moves. A true 'out of body' experience!\n\nFOR INSTRUCTORS\n\nFree up instructors: spend less time teaching patterns, more time helping students refine their technique and master more advanced skills.\n\nAdd variety to training: rotate students through stations, some spending time in PozeAR, some one-on-one tuition, some group work.\n\nHelp students learn faster: by teaching all moves from their own perspective, PozeAR capitialises on student's muscle memory.\n\nMirror mode: if your dojo has mirrors, PozeAR projects a blue outline inside the mirror for students to match.",
