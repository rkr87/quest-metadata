This course enables learners to apply knowledge and practice setting up a biosafety cabinet (also known as a biological safety cabinet, or BSC) in a virtual laboratory in order to identify the major parts, demonstrate how to maintain positive airflow, demonstrate how to prepare for work, apply safe-work practices, demonstrate how to decontaminate and shutdown, and conduct emergency shutdown procedures of a Class II Biosafety Cabinet. This course is developed for laboratory professionals and supplements the existing CDC eLearning course on the same topic found on the CDC LabTraining page.",
