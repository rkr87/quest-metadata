        "description": "Warning: This experience features flashing images and is not suitable for photosensitive viewers.\n\nIt's mid-morning, and the sun peaks through blinds into an open-plan kitchen and lounge. A darkened television reflects the rest of the roomâ€”a familiar place, a little unkempt and filled with everyday objects. What would it be like if this recognisable place suddenly became the backdrop for some very unfamiliar challenges?\n\nDeveloped in partnership with support services not-for-profit Mercy Connect, this experience explores the efficacy of an immersive approach to strengthening communication and understanding between advocates and people with a disability by simulating a variety of effects that may be familiar to those with diverse and high care needs.\n\nYou'll learn through first-hand experience how many of the interactions generally taken for granted may look or feel different other people.",
