        "description": "Space Atlas VR is an interactive guide to space and space exploration. Journey through the Solar System, visit the surface of the Moon and Mars, interact with accurate maps of the nearby stars and known exoplanets, examine the 3D models and mission timelines of various space exploration systems. Space Atlas VR provides access to accurate information about space in an immersive and interactive environment through an intuitive user interface that supports both hand tracking and controllers.\n\nSpace Atlas VR is organised into three chapters: [1] The Earth: our planet as seen from space, learn about the artificial satellites orbiting it, and discover details about our Moon. [2] The Solar System: an accurate 3D model of our solar system. The positions and movements of each celestial body are based on simulation data from NASA. Visit these celestial bodies, and delve into the technical details of various exploration missions. [3] The Universe: a series of immersive scenes, including an accurate 3D map of all stars within 30 light-years of the Sun, a detailed representation of our galaxy - the Milky Way, a comprehensive 3D map of known exoplanets, and a model of the Local Group, the region of space that houses our galaxy and its neighbours.\n\nThis is the free DEMO version of Space Atlas VR (2025). Our small team is working on the full version, constantly adding new contents, polishing the graphics and sound, and fixing bugs.",
