        "description": "Alright, we can do this in two ways. \n\nWe can tell you about a story rich 4-player co-op campaign, the Municipal Mayhem™, dozens of guns, a myriad of attachments, skins, masks, deathmatch, tournament ladders, minigames, leaderboards, climbing, graffiti, hidden rewards, the GNOP, bossfights, free updates, dedicated customer support, and so on. \n\nOr, we can tell you what it’s really about: \n\nJaguar blood, gunpowder pheromone, treasure chest musk, gun oil bite, winning lottery ticket crumple, last bullet adrenaline, high fives, f*** yeahs, burning rubber, superhero-landing on dust. \n\nThe world’s about to end, and you can give it a final push. Rob a train, screw up, go on a grand adventure full of grit and juice, blow up the streets, earn a bounty on your head, and keep the engine running. Join Frank, Cody, Udo, and Kevin, four misfits out to get rich or kill anyone else trying. \n\nCome play Gambit!",
