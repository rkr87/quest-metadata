        "description": "QUEST 2, 3, AND PRO. MULTIPLAYER.\n \nGIVE YOUR VR WORKOUTS A DESTINATION. Enjoy VR fitness adventures with friends, without leaving your home or gym, on your fitness treadmill or without one. And now a stationary bike option is available!\n\nJust hop on a treadmill or bike, wirelessly connect, and start exercising. Octonic’s Motion Engine precisely aligns speed in VR with the speed of the treadmill or bike, allowing users to exercise seamlessly in VR worlds we’ve developed. You’ll see your treadmill or bike in passthrough, making the experience natural and safe. \n\nOctonic wirelessly connects the Quest with numerous Bluetooth FTMS-compatible treadmill and bike brands. On treadmills, users fully control the machine (incl. start/stop and speed) from VR. On bikes, VR speed matches the physical bike speed, while users can control resistance right from VR. In non-connected mode, Octonic is compatible with all fitness treadmills. \n\nFor those without access to fitness machines, we offer a stationary, run-in-place mode. \n\nDemos of all our VR worlds, which include gaming, competitive, and recreational trails, are included with your free download. Full worlds are available in-app as à la carte purchases, an all-worlds bundle, or through subscription packages.\n\nOctonic supports a swappable hand-tracking and controller interface. We recommend a non-fabric head strap, like Kiwi.\n",
