If you have automatic updates turned off, you'll need to turn those back on in your device settings.\n-Multiplayer will not be backwards compatible, so all players in a private room will need to upgrade to the latest Atlantis version.\n-Resolution Upgrade: Quest 2 players will see a 33% improvement in clarity! If you are manually adjusting the resolution through Sidequest, you'll want to revert that override.\n-In practice mode, players will automatically advance to the next hole rather than going to the scorecard overview."
