        "description": "Based on the graphic novel from writer Grant Morrison and artist Frazer Irving, Legendary VR partners with Schell Games to bring the world of ‘Annihilator' to life for fans in a whole new way.\n\nThe critically-acclaimed title from Legendary Comics tells the story of washed-up screenwriter Ray Spass – a man caught in a downward spiral of broken relationships, wild parties, and self-destruction. Out of luck and out of chances, he’s one failed script away from fading into obscurity. Little does he know, he’s about the write the story of his life. As his imagination runs rampant, Ray must join forces with his own fictional character, Max Nomax, on a reality-bending race to stop the entire universe from imploding… Without blowing his own mind in the process. \n\nThis innovative VR experience places users at the center of their own psychedelic space opera, transforming the 2D art of the book into immersive, interactive environments that blur the lines between fantasy and reality.",
