        "description": "Proper hand hygiene is considered the single most important method of preventing and controlling infections in healthcare facilities. The Tork VR Clean Hands Training for hospitals offers a hands-on training for healthcare staff to improve their hand hygiene compliance according to WHO's 5 moments of hand hygiene. \n\nPutting on the VR headset, you get ready to start a new shift. In the training you can choose to be a nurse or a physician. Although you are in a virtual world, youâ€™ll face a series of real-life situations and practice hand hygiene using your own hands. \n\nA study shows that 8 out of 10 healthcare professionals would like to improve their hand hygiene compliance. But traditional forms of hand hygiene training are often perceived as uninspiring. The award winning, Tork Clean Hands Training for hospitals, invites users into a digital world where they can interact and train on the World Health Organization's My 5 Moments For Hand Hygiene. ",
