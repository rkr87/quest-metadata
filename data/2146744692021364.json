        "description": "Endless Runner meets Cinematic Horror. Awaken from cryo-stasis to live out your nightmare, as you navigate the futuristic corridors full of deadly traps. Experience the only Horror-Themed Endless Runner that lets you Stop! Now with a brand-new flamethrower weapon, in addition to selectable checkpoints, and multiple difficulty settings!\n\nFeaturing simple controls: Press the touchpad to move forward. Use your light to guide the way. Let go of the movement button at anytime to stop. After reaching Checkpoint 4, hold down the trigger button to fire your flamethrower weapon. Game controls and difficulty settings can be changed during the loading sequence.\n\nPro Tips: In most rooms, there are only two paths you can take. If going right kills you, try going left. If running kills you, try stopping, and vice versa.\n\n\"Fear Incarnate\" means \"Fear in the Flesh\". The only flesh this game can access, is yours.\n\nRequires: 3DOF controller. This game features Oculus Go App Compatibility on Quest!",
