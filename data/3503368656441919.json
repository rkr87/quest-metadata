        "description": "VictoryXR's virtual reality frog dissection software is a hands-on dissection opportunity that users can experience through the power of virtual reality. This true to life experience covers each step that a student would take if they were dissecting a real frog in their classroom. Along the way, a hologram of our teacher - national runner-up Teacher of the Year, Wendy Martin - will pop up to provide instruction and information to users.\n\nAll of the instruction follows the Next Generations Science Standards (NGSS), the national science standards for the United States. The dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail so that they are a suitable substitute for the real thing in a classroom. Lifelike physical models mean that the frog appears as it would in a real dissection allowing science teachers to feel good about substituting virtual reality for the real thing. ",
