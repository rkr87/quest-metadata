        "description": "In this game you have the opportunity to swing your racket to your heart's content, hit the ball with all your might, and smash the tiles on the walls to pieces. Modest but pleasant graphics in a futuristic style are waiting for you. And you will definitely like the physics of interaction between rackets and balls!\n\nWhen you destroy a brick, you have a chance to knock some bonus out of it. For example:\n- extra ball\n- a protective field that will not allow you to lose the ball\n- changed direction of gravity (you will never see this in real life)\n- turning your ball into a fireball\n- time dilation (slowmo)\n\nFor a variety of play, you can change the appearance of your ball and rackets. You will experience very different sensations when playing with different racquets. This is not just a change in visual appearance, but a change in the gaming experience.",
