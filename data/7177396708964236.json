        "description": "Boom lift vehicles offer a safe and effective way for workers to access heights of up to 150 feet while eliminating the need for ladders or scaffolding. The boom lift platform can hold multiple workers and transport substantial materials to high elevations. These adaptable machines are suitable for indoor and outdoor use, including on irregular terrain, making them indispensable in construction sites, industrial settings, warehouses, and commercial properties.\n\nBackground Primer:\nAn introduction to aerial lifts provides knowledge of different types of lifts, their components, safety concerns, tipping lines, fall protection measures, and the fundamentals of conducting a pre-operation inspection. Participants engage in sort-and-match activities to familiarize themselves with the central controls.\n\nSimulation Activities:\nAn interactive simulation offers a hands-on learning approach for participants to safely experience and master the operation of a boom lift in a controlled, lifelike environment. Participants are guided to equip the appropriate personal protective equipment and perform a walk-around inspection of the lift before operating the lift. Then, participants must navigate a VR warehouse to retrieve task items and repair them at various heights, ranging between 45 and 65 feet.\n",
