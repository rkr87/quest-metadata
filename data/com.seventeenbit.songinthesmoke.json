Enter a dangerous world and craft weapons, make clothes, build fires, and brew potions to defend yourself against vicious predators. Block, parry, and strike back with your club, attack from distance with your bow, or use your wits to sneak past the lethal creatures that call this land their home. \n\nThe hunted also becomes the hunter. Use your senses to stalk prey in virtual reality: track their smell, follow their footprints, and plan your strike. When you’re ready, show off your skill with intuitive and responsive VR controls that let you execute the perfect shot.\n\nTravel between wildly different environments as you follow the guidance of your ancestors, and uncover the secrets of Song in the Smoke.",
