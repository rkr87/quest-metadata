Backed by an arsenal of new weapons, you must test them on your Robotic Dummy.  Use  guns, blades and anything you can get your hands on.\n\nYour test dummy is a lifeless, non-feeling, non-sentient hunk of metal designed for testing weaponry.  \n\nEvery wack, hit, gunshot or sword wound you deal to your dummy results in credits for your job well done.  Use your hard earned cash to unlock the station's premium weapons and mini-games.  \n\nSpace Chamber 51 brings you:\n\n* An unlockable test arsenal\n\n* Earned mini-games to keep you motivated to perform test\n\n* Interactable items  to be found around the station for testing\n\n* Dual-wield your weapons of choice and use them how you want\n\nStep into the Space Station and start testing!",
