        "description": "You would have like to get some foil fencing practice in tonight. Unfortunately, your fencing club is closed tonight...\n\nBut you have another option. You could fence with the Brazil Fencing Club, located in the exotic lands of Brazil. What? South America? No... This Brazil is located in the foil fencing capital of the world: Indiana.\n\nWelcome to Brazil Indiana's Fencing Club, We never close. We have fencers practicing at our club 24-hours a day and 365 days a year. Anyone anywhere can fence with this club. No long car trips necessary. This is because our club only exists in virtual reality! Hope you will join us at practice today.\n\nThe Brazil Fencing Club has nine hoosier foil fencers ready to challenge you. Test your fencing skill and see if it holds up against these wacky fencers. Use actual real world fencing skills (like beat attacks, disengages, parry ripostes and more) in a virtual reality game that closely simulates actual real world foil fencing.",

(sorry, despite the epees and saber, still only a foil fencing game)\n\nOnce earned, your weapons can be changed by selecting from the wooden weapon stands on the back wall while \nthe game is displaying the selection menu at the end of the opponent's side of the strip. \n\nAdjust controller footwork speed to match your real footwork speed. You will have to advance and retreat the fencing piste while the game times you. \n\nYou can now adjust your weapon/VR controller offset. This has many possible uses:\n  *Simply adjust weapon/hand placement to your liking. \n  *Allows you to use a real fencing grip attachment to your controller. (Sorry I don't sell these attachments, you will have to build one yourself)\n  *Pommeling a French grip like a epeeist.\n   \nSetting to allow your weapon blades to glow with priority(right-of-way) when fencing.\n\nLock out controller rotating/turning setting while fencing for better control.\n\nBUG FIX: When canting your blade, the bend no longer starts behind the guard."
