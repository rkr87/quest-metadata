        "description": "Do you need help overcoming public speaking anxiety?\nDo you want to communicate more effectively?\n\nOvation was developed to help you build your skills and confidence by providing real-time training tools and feedback as you speak to a realistic, simulated audience.\n\nImport your own text and slides, choose from dozens of speech tools, and adjust your audience's attire and behavior.\n\nOvation provides hundreds of prompts, with categories including interview and leadership, or you can add your own.\n\nChoose from 4 environments and speak to dozens of virtual audience members — real people scanned into 3D models who smile, clap, and get distracted by their phones.\n\nOvation records your speeches in 3D, enabling you to watch your performance from every angle and identify areas for improvement.\n\nEffective training tools guide your improvement and ensure you are always on the right track.\n\nOvation captures key analytics throughout your speech and produces grades for your review. You’re able to identify areas for improvement and focus on them in subsequent practice sessions.\n\nJoin with others in a multiplayer session. Deliver speeches together with a co-worker, get advice from a friend, or just bring others into the venue to watch.\n\nAre you ready for your Ovation?",
