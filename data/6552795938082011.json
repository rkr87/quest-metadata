If you decipher one of them, contact us (demeter@novelab.net) with the name of the author!  \n\n \nThanks a lot for all your help, this game was a real challenge for us as it is our first game; and MR brought so many challenges uncharted so far. We are proud some enjoyed the game, the art and the narrative.  \n\n<3  \n\n "
