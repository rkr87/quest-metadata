        "description": "Gamepad Required\n\nGet right inside the world of Minecraft with virtual reality. Build, explore and battle mobs - do all the things you know and love - but from a fresh perspective. With a VR headset on, coming face-to-face with monstrous mobs takes on new meaning; creeping into dark caves inspires even greater trepidation thanks to 3D audio; and the light of a gorgeous sunrise seems to envelop you more completely. \n\nMinecraft on Gear VR supports all the features of Minecraft, including the full game loop, marketplace, multiplayer, Realms, Add-Ons, and more!  For more information on Minecraft in VR, please visit http://minecraft.net/vr.\n\nComfort levels will vary for every player, and prolonged use can sometimes cause motion sickness and eye-strain. Please refer to your hardware’s safety guidelines before deciding whether VR is for you. Recommended age 13+.",
