        "description": "The Shock Troops are sent anywhere in the Galaxy where a problem needs to be solved with extreme prejudice.\nPlayers will shoot their way through an epic interstellar adventure and uncover a dark conspiracy to end mankind.\n\nInspired by classics such as Doom and Quake, Shock Troops visual features include pixel-art textures and a mix of 3D environments and 2D sprites, seamlessly blending classic style with modern lighting.\n\nShock Troops gameplay aims at preserving the high-octane physicality of the classic shooters. Players will dodge incoming projectiles while responding in kind with a varied arsenal with various effects, at range, or in melee, with some impressive weapons or special powers.\n\nYou will be fighting your way through derelict space stations, frozen colonies, mining asteroids, large military spaceships, and lush alien planets. Each of these worlds will feature large “open” areas, set-pieces and theater of epic firefights.\n[includes the \"Ghost of the Lone Whale\" Halloween special]\n\n\n\n",
