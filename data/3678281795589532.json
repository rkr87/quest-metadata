        "description": "Imagine being transported to one of the most significant and somber sites of the 20th century, Auschwitz, and experiencing the story of a survivor in a deeply personal and immersive way. The Eva Holocaust Experience Virtual Reality Tour offers a unique and unforgettable journey, putting you in the shoes of Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of the Holocaust and the infamous Mengele Twins experiments.\n\nThrough cutting-edge virtual reality technology, you'll embark on a 360-degree tour of four pivotal locations at Auschwitz, each one central to Eva's remarkable story. You'll find yourself standing on the selection platform, where Eva and her family were torn apart; inside the barracks, where she endured unimaginable conditions; at the \"Blood Lab,\" where she and her twin sister Miriam were subjected to inhumane experiments; and outside the crematoria, where Eva publicly forgave her tormentors 50 years after liberation.\n\nAt each location, Eva's own voice guides you, sharing her memories and reflections with haunting intimacy. You'll feel as though you're walking alongside her, reliving her experiences and gaining a profound understanding of her resilience and courage. Accompanying videos provide historical context and personal insights, enriching your comprehension of this pivotal moment in history.\n",
