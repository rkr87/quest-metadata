In this game, you'll take turns throwing a spear at a target, with the goal of hitting the bullseye or a designated area on the target to progress to the next section. \nYou'll be racing against an AI opponent, so you'll need to be quick and accurate if you want to come out on top.\nThe difficulty increases as you progress through the sections, with longer distances, more challenging targets, and obstacles to avoid.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Download Spear-Master today and see if you have what it takes to become the ultimate champion!",
