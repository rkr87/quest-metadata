        "description": "Campfire is the best way to communicate 3D information throughout the physical product lifecycle. Whether you're streamlining design reviews, training, or troubleshooting, Campfire makes it easier than ever.\n\nA NEW APPROACH \nCampfire takes a new approach to 3D collaboration. It's based on the way people communicate most naturally â€“ around things. Instead of sharing screenfuls of CAD, images, and text, you share interactive 3D content with your team around it, even if they're around the globe.\n\nEASY TO USE \nCampfire uses passthrough on Meta Quest to make 3D collaboration feel even more natural. Users see content in front of them, and remote participants around it - even if they're joining from a desktop or mobile device.\n\nSIMPLE & POWERFUL TOOLS \nChoose from powerful tools accessible from a single button. Use the laser pointer to make your point. Use text and sketch annotations to communicate with colleagues in other time zones. Defy the laws of physics with tools like slice, explode, and grab, to show complex concepts simply.\n\n40+ TYPES OF 3D/CAD  \nCreate scenes on the desktop using your existing CAD/3D files. No optimization or coding required. Campfire Cloud optimizes your scenes for Meta Quest automatically and securely.\n\nFREE STARTER PLAN \nCampfire Starter allows you to share 5 projects of 5 scenes with 5 users. Scenes can be created using files up to 25MB in the following formats: FBX, OBJ, GLB/TF, PLY, STL, USD/Z/A/C. Enterprise plans are available at Campfire3d.com. ",
