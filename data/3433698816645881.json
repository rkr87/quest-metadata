        "description": "You are trapped. Bound by magic by unknown captors. But you are a Flow Weaver and can move between dimensions. Travel amongst them, learn new spells, and uncover the secrets of this strange world to orchestrate your escape.\n\nFlow Weaver is a narrative escape room game. The player explores and experiments with their environment, moving between different magical dimensions to solve intuitive puzzles towards the goal of escape.\n\nGameplay allows you to move between your cell and multiple different dimensions (or \"Flows\") as you discover them, learning how each Flow affects the world in different ways. The player uses those differences to solve puzzles and challenges, learn new skills or spells, and uncover new objects and new puzzles. \n\nFlow Weaver is an immersive seated experience with fully voiced dialogue, a moving soundtrack, and rich narrative lore for fantasy fans to dig into.\n",
