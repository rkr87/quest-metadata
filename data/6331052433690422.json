        "description": "Experience the award-winning creative sandbox photography game in VR!\n\nSet in Tauranga, Aotearoa off the back of an impending crisis, life is bleak for those living in the city. As a courier for the Tauranga Express who is also an avid photographer, you have the freedom to travel around the city to document the impending doom through the lense of your camera.\n\n▼ Making Use of VR for a More Personal Experience\nObserve the doom and gloom sprawling across your sights, move around and interact with the environment in a more natural manner. Unlike the standard non-VR version, dress yourself in the skin of your choice, get the attention of people around you with a simple snap of your fingers, and pose with gestures in photos and selfies. \n\n▼ Awaken Your Creative Side\nThe game presents you with a list of objectives called \"Photo Bounties\". Simply snap away to complete all Photo Bounties before delivering the parcel to proceed to the next stage. Each photo you take will be judged on its color, content, and composition. \n\n▼ Full creative control\nWith a strong emphasis on the freedom to expression, the game does not set rules on what makes a good or bad photo. Take and edit photos with the various tools available to you to produce your own unique snaps. The whole point is for you to explore and have fun with your creative side!\n\n▼ What is an 'Umurangi'?\nUmurangi is the Te Reo word for Red Sky.",
