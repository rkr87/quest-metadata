        "description": "We designed Surgery Prep with input from clinicians (physicians and child life specialists), parents, and adolescents to help adolescents, ages 13 and older, prepare for surgery. Players acclimate to the perioperative environment by helping a narwhal prepare for surgery. Players engage with the narwhal from pre-op to the operating room. Finally, they work with the surgical team of sea creatures to help the narwhal fall asleep and wake up in recovery. The narwhal goes through preoperative procedures the player will likely go through the day of surgery in a real hospital, such as being weighed and having their blood pressure taken. At the beginning of the experience, there is an option to toggle a voice-over on or off for dialog boxes that guide the player to engage in different activities throughout the experience to earn stars. Medical devices, such as the pulse oximeter, are intentionally referred to as gadgets so that adults can tailor explanations for device names and functions for players of different ages. We also designed navigation for younger adolescents. Players will only use the right controller to point at objects and click any of the buttons to complete activities.  While this experience may help adolescents prepare for surgery, we also hope that it sparks important conversations between adolescents and adults to help answer adolescentsâ€™ questions and put them at ease before their surgical experience.
