As a museum of the future, MoCAAD will embed technology in exhibitions, programs, and practices, going beyond digital art offerings to explore ways technology can elevate experiences, educate and reach audiences around the world. \n\nMiami MoCAAD is digital-first. Flexible, nimble and distributed, it is both deeply rooted in the local Miami context and global in its reach. It meets its audiences where they are, appearing in diverse digital spaces and creative venues, curating exhibitions and experiences that connect local and international audiences with the work of experienced and emerging contemporary artists of the African Diaspora and Africa. It will serve as a bridge between a constellation of different and diverse voices and art venues of Africa and the African Diaspora around the world from the Americas and Caribbean to Africa, and Europe ",
