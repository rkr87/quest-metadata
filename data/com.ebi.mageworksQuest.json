        "description": "With your spellbook in one hand, and your staff in the other, travel to distant lands to discover new spells, battle foes, and collect staff crafting resources.  \n\nMageWorks puts the player into the role of a mage that has just finished their magic school, and now must venture out to explore the world...and pay off their magic school loan.  With side jobs like riding a roller coaster, or battling waves of enemies with newly discovered spells, earn gold to work your way out of magic school debt.  \n\nUse the observatory to find and unlock up to 25 spells.  Reach into the skies with your staff to summon a ball of lightning, or use the energy of the ground to summon protective shields.  Six different spell classes and a study hall to play with your spells.  \n\nUse your workshop to craft a custom staff to bring on your adventures.  Your staff ideas come to life with crystal shaping, wood carving, and painting. \n",
