        "description": "Face all the horrors that the living and the dead can offer in this new VR adventure in The Walking Dead universe. Travel through the ruins of walker infested New Orleans as you fight, sneak, scavenge, and survive each day unraveling a city wide mystery within the iconic quarters. Encounter desperate factions and lone survivors who could be friend or foe. Whether you help others or take what you want by force, every choice you make has consequences. What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? \n \nScavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues.\n \nBe wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise.\n \nCraft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more.\n \nSurvive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others.\n \nTest your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.",
