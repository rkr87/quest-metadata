        "description": "Treekeepers is about a giant tree that needs saving and a hot air balloon at the disposal of you and your 4-person crew. Along the way, encounter oversized obstacles and pests that are out to stop you. One player flies, one player defends the aircraft, and the others kill the bad guys.\n\nDon't like who's flying? Then take the flight stick from them! But you'd better learn to work together quickly, because it's your team vs. the world.",
