You'll need to scavenge more whilst receiving less total ammo!    \n- The highest difficulty spikes have been smoothed out whilst still roughly keeping their original feel. Noticeable changes are the ‘SUNSET RIDERS’ end fight & both the ‘OOPS’ bridge & end fight.\n- Configured Fungus Counts per difficulty with our brand new system, greatly increasing how much fungus spawns on Survival & Apocalypse.\n- The new difficulties are called ‘Story, Adventure, Survival, Apocalypse’. We recommend most players that have prior VR experience to try out Survival! \n- ‘Story’ is meant for players that want to experience the campaign without too much threat or challenge - allowing you to focus on the story and play fetch with Buddy!\n- ‘Adventure’ is for those new to VR. You might like some challenge but prefer it to still be balanced in your favor.\n- ‘Survival’ is how we’ve always envisioned Arizona Sunshine 2 to be experienced. This is the recommended difficulty for those that have prior VR experience. \n- ‘Apocalypse’ is for those that want a hardcore zombie experience. You’ll have to scavenge every nook and cranny to get by and will be dead in just a few hits. \n\nToggle Grip\n- Added a new Grip Mode option. You can now select ‘Toggle Grip’ within your Settings!\n- Toggle Grip will keep your weapon stuck to your hand even after you stop pressing down on the Grip button.\nDropping weapons entirely - for example to share them with your co-op partner - can be done by pressing on the bottom face button for 1 second.\n\nBalancing\n- Changed the Tommy Gun to use rifle ammo instead of pistol ammo, as to make it a more viable option!\n- Health regen is now fixed for all difficulties, preventing the red 'throbbing' vignette from staying on at higher difficulties if you couldn't find any food.  \n- Made the Shotgun deal more damage on higher difficulties, now allowing you to still one-shot zombies when you’re close enough! \n- Reduced the Penetration Force of Shotguns, preventing one pellet from going through 5 zombies at a time.\n- Made the M67 Frag Grenade have a bigger explosion radius, whilst slightly reducing the Stick Grenade’s radius.\n- Zombies’ Attack Impact Fraction should now better match their animations, preventing unfair situations where you'd get damage before the zombie visually hits you.\n- Dynamic ammo Spawning will no longer kick-in as hard when you start running out, preventing some of the fully-stacked ammo crates you would find from time to time.\n\nFixes & Tweaks\n- Added LIV support allowing content creators to better capture their experience!\n- Reduced the respawn delay after dying, now allowing you to reload the level earlier.\n- Fixed the co-op player losing resources and ammo in co-op after a level load.\n- Fixed co-op players spawning at the start of the level after a checkpoint had been loaded.\n- Fixed zombie ragdolls breaking after playing for a long time. \n- Fixed doors not being able to be properly opened due to zombie bodies.\n- Added tooltips to the settings menu to better explain what each option changes.\n- Added a dedicated menu where you can scroll through all your available cosmetics!\n- Fixed snapping points for climbing sections in various levels.\n- Fixed the bloom post processing effect for all Steam versions.\n- Fixed items sometimes not dropping in manual grip mode when releasing the grip button.\n- Fixed when zombies fell down they sometimes used the wrong stand up animation.\n- Fixed Buddy sometimes still wearing his equipment during the hospital cutscene.\n- Fixed the toy helicopter causing your hand to move in slow motion.\n- Fixed that crafted items were not properly saved in checkpoints.\n- Fixed the ammo belt not properly re-enabling after a checkpoint in the level ‘BAD DOG’.\n- Fixed that zombies would already be banging on the windows when entering the gas station.\n- Fixed the orientation of the minigun when the other player was holding it in co-op.\n- Fixed players spawning in the same exact location in the level “BAD DOG’ in co-op.\n- Fixed not all waves properly triggering when dying and reloading the checkpoint in the level ‘BEST FRIENDS FOREVER’.\n- Fixed selection circle lagging behind when holding a grenade.\n- Fixed the heating effect of the minigun. It now only heats up the barrels instead of the entire front part.\n- Fixed not being able to climb back up when respawning at the checkpoint on top of the gas station.\n- Fixed parts of the Canyon culling in the level ‘OOPS’ when Buddy is searching for a weapon.\n- Fixed the gun sometimes not equipping when pressing grip with ‘equip on no target’ enabled.\n- Fixed the ‘Back to menu’ button not working in the score results screen when playing single-player horde mode.\n- Fixed screen staying red when dying in co-op and getting the ‘waiting for players’ screen.\n- Fixed container door handles that were hard to grab in the level ‘CHOO-CHOO, MOTHERF*CKERS’.\n- Fixed offline players not being able to connect to the local server in cases when loading a level happens twice within a second.\n- Fixed zombie animation when they’re hit by a blunt weapon on the legs.\n- Fixed lobby screen not showing correct region when game started without internet access.\n- Fixed PlayStation 5 host not showing the joined player in the lobby screen.\n- Fixed drum-based weapons (e.g. revolver) not always closing by flicking it\n- Fixed player getting stuck in the void after loading a level in co-op occasionally\n"
