        "description": "Design interiors, buildings, virtual spaces and more with Arkio on Meta Quest and Meta Quest Pro. Try new design ideas and collaborate with others using VR, desktop and mobile to make better design decisions faster.\n\nWith room import and passthrough you can design, mix and share realities like never before. Move freely around large spaces or entire floors with the new boundaryless mode. Place virtual furniture in your living room, sketch an extension on your home, carve a virtual window into a wall or remove entire walls! View 3D models as scale models or experience them at true scale in the real world. Color passthrough on Meta Quest 3 & Pro brings mixed reality in Arkio vividly to life.\n\nArkio features a unique volumetric modeling kernel that allows you to intuitively create and modify shapes, carve openings and design with parametric components as if working with physical building blocks.\n\nEasily upload and download images, and large 3D models directly to and from Meta Quest using Arkio Cloud. Import/export from Unity, Revit, Rhino, SketchUp, LiDAR apps and more.",
