        "description": "Learning Human Osteology is an important step for anyone with career aspirations in the medical field. We have designed a virtual-reality course that brings the best parts from a standard Osteology course right to you. For this course, we have 3-D scanned real human bones with a high-quality 3-D scanner, so all of the minute details of every bone are there. You will be virtually holding real human bones in your hands, turning them over, inspecting them up close, trying to figure out how best to learn the names, features, and sides of the 200+ bones of the human body. You will be led through a learning process in the same sequence that we use in our typical 15-week in-person course. First, you will learn the names and locations of all the bones in the human body. Then you will learn the individual bones and their sides. Finally, you will learn the important features of the bones. During and after each section of the course you will be tested to confirm your knowledge of the material.",
