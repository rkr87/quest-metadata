        "description": "More than 2.5 million young people suffer a concussion in the United States each year. If not treated properly, a concussion may have lasting physical, emotional, and cognitive effects. Concussion education is critical for ensuring athletes can play their sport healthier, for longer.\n\n(NEW!) The Brain Fly-Through conceptualizes an otherwise “invisible injury,” as world mountain biking champion, Kate Courtney, takes the viewer on a journey through the human brain. Using dramatic race footage coupled with her own personal concussion experiences, it showcases the brain’s blood vessels, nervous system, and cerebrospinal fluid cavities, emphasizing the complexity and fragility of the brain, as well as the importance of caring for it.\n\nCrashCourse Football brings you directly onto the field during a high school football game and features star football players that share the latest medical knowledge on the prevention and treatment of concussions.",
