        "description": "Have you ever wished you could have seen ancient Rome at the peak of its glory? Now you can. This app uses the magic of VR to take you on a flight in a hot air balloon over the entire now-vanished ancient city. See how the Rome Reborn team has, over the last 22 years, painstakingly brought the cityâ€™s thousands of buildings back to life, learn about the famous seven hills and other natural features, and find out how the ancient Romans lived, governed and provisioned themselves, took time off for recreation, and worshiped their gods.  See the aqueducts, theater district, the Roman Forum and nearby imperial fora, the imperial palace, the Colosseum, Circus Maximus, the Mausolea of Augustus and Hadrian, the Pyramid of Cestius, and much, much more.  The app has more than 30 points of interest and over two hours of content. It is available in these languages: Chinese, English, Italian.",
