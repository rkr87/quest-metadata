        "description": "The Grid, a digital frontier. Try to picture your room space as a three-dimensional grid of voxels, like pixelss in 3D. They can be either inactive or active. In the active state they can be of whatever color, or material in general. They may be blinking, pulsating, emanating sound, etc. They can also move between adjacent, empty grid spaces. They may also have various behaviours and interactions enabled on them.\n\nOn top of that Grid, we can come up with a multitude of mini-games. Here are some examples:\n\n- Jewel-Collector - A level consists of a set of voxels that are “gold” and can be collected by the player (or players, in local co-op or competitive) to earn points.\n\n- Color Finder - During gameplay a random color is being called out. The player(s) need to look around and find voxels of that colour and hold on to them or else they will be eliminated.\n\n- TwisterX - Similar to the original, physical game of Twister, the player(s) need to subsequently position their limbs on the indicated voxels, which get randomly called-out.\n\n- Beat Catcher - Voxels are approaching the player(s) from various directions (or just in straight lines in front of them) and they need to “catch” them, to the beat.\n\n- DodgerX - The player needs to dodge incoming obstacles, using their whole body.\n\n- Endless possibilities… - With the generic concept of the Grid, we can come up with varying ideas for mini-games utilizing it.",
