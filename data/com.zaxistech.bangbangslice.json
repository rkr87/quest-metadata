        "description": "Shoot and slice your way through enemies across unique levels and scenarios in this homage to 80's action movies. The only way to move is to defeat an enemy and grab their weapon out of mid air, taking their place: Strategy is just as important as reflexes, so moving through enemies in a correct order will prevent you from being stranded.\n\nFeatures 40+ unique weapons including blades, grenades, pistols, SMGs and shotguns.\n\nThere are currently 40 levels and counting, each presenting a unique combat scenario with different sets of goals. Some require you to assassinate a VIP, in others youll need to escape the room. Most levels have multiple different paths to victory, and enemies use randomized weapons so each playthrough will present a new challenge. Each level is designed to be difficult while you learn enemy patterns and positions, so keep playing to hone your skills and improve your score.",
