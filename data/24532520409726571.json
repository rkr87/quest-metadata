        "description": "Track Hoes are the toughest excavating vehicles used across multiple industries. They are used for material handling, landscaping, demolition, mining, trenching, river dredging, and construction projects. The track hoe consists of a boom, arm, and bucket connected to a cab that sits on a turret that can rotate 360 degrees for increased visibility. Track hoes use tank-like tracks and have a low center of gravity providing exceptional stability. Participants will operate a track hoe and complete various tasks on an active worksite as part of this engaging simulation. \n\nOverview & Activities: \nParticipants begin with an overview that provides context and helps identify key parts and components outside and inside the vehicle, safety tips, and the basics of a walk-around inspection performed before using any heavy machinery. Participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to reinforce essential controls and their location inside the vehicle. They are then asked to perform a single task to become familiar with operating the vehicle in a VR environment.\n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn, and practice operating a dump truck in a safe and realistic format. Participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct a walk-around inspection of the vehicle. Participants are challenged to complete tasks at an active worksite, including digging a trench, placing irrigation pipes, and backfilling the trench. ",
