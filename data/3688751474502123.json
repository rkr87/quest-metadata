        "description": "A VR survival horror roguelike.\n\nTrapped in a dying spaceship filled with horrors, you must explore, survive, and find your way back to the safety of Earth. Cosmodread features a rich, tense and immersive atmosphere that will make you forget about the world outside the headset.\n\nEXPLORE: \nSearch for resources and find a way home. Every run will have you play in a new procedurally generated layout, with random positions for rooms, corridors, items and hazards, and different emergent situations. You’ll never quite know what’s behind the next door.\n\nSURVIVE: \nUse your own hands to interact with the environment. Open doors, drawers and lockers and rummage through their contents. Collect basic resources, and craft weapons and equipment to deal with both enemies and hazards.\n\nFIGHT: \nCrouch behind cover and shoot at enemies with your crossbow, or set a trap for them to walk into. But remember: ammo is scarce!",
