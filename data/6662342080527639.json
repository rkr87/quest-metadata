        "description": "Have you ever wanted to try doing the craziest trick shots around town? Now you can with Trick Shot VR! Switch between using a ping pong ball, a basketball, or a frisbee to land the best shots. \n\nEach trick shot item has 3 unique levels with their goal item set around the neighborhood. Once all 3 levels are completed in a section, that trick shot item can be used around the neighborhood in Freeplay! \n\nFeatures include :\n- Spawning on Grip - With the spawn on grip feature, you can continue to spawn throwables as many times as you like! \n\n- Interactable Openings - Doors and windows can be opened to add another layer of challenge to shots.\n\n- Moveable Pans - The pots and pans in the kitchen are pickupable. use them to bounce  throws off of!\n\n- Clear Spawned - Too many thrown items? Open the quick hand menu and clear them.\n\n- Dynamic Scoring - Scoring is based off of how far thrown an object is, and how many times it bounced. Each object also has a specific bounce multiplier!\n\nThe real question is, how many bounces can you get, and how far of a throw can you land?  ",
