This rank includes a new way to play the levels that's more challenging but more rewarding. \n\n- Updated scoring system: Points are now relative to how close you were to making contact with the dummy arm (block/punch) at the right time. Making contact exactly when it meets the ghost will grant 100% points, the further you are off that, the less points you get. Level passing scores have been updated to match this. \n\n- [FULL GAME] New menu layout in Train section of the menu to allow for switching between ranks. As well as new colors for each rank.\n\n- [FULL GAME] 22 achievements have been added to the store platform! There are now a total of 34 achievements.\n\n- [PCVR ONLY] [FULL GAME] Fixed issue where after selecting music in the `Extra` section it was not possible to return to mods. \n\n- Blocking correctly now makes the dummy arm increase speed, rather than slow down. So watch out!\n\n- Punching a blade from behind will not make the blade come back at you (yes that was a thing, but now it's not).\n\n- [FULL GAME] Punch planks to start levels will not appear until a level has been selected for the Mode you are currently viewing. No more accidental tutorial triggering!\n\n- Fixed issue where game wouldn't pause when removing your device from your head.\n\n- Fixed issue where game hands would center in front of you when you press the device menu button.\n\n- [QUEST ONLY] [FULL GAME] Added visual representation of play-space size (from guardian data) in both the starting scene and when selecting Fight mode.\n\n- Stop Xmas tree from being switched out with the lantern every time you load the game (for those of you who want that Xmas feel all year round).\n\n- [FULL GAME] Fixed issue with challenges on menu not displaying properly in some instances.\n\n- [FULL GAME] Fixed issue where going from some menu pages back to Dojo the leaderboards would no longer appear.
