        "description": "Experience the power of interactive choices in Virtual Reality\nQuesVR is the solution for VR training and education.\n\nSimply put, it is a VR app for the Meta Quest VR headsets. With the app you can play VR videos that outline a scenario. During these videos you can ask multiple choice questions. Based on your answer, you may be led to another video, with a different outcome. This is a transformative approach where interactive VR experiences redefine professional learning. With QuesVR, every choice determines your path, immersing you in a VR education journey that is as informative as it is engaging.\n\nStep into the future of learning\n\nQuesVR goes beyond traditional boundaries and invites users to explore the 'Metaverse' of interactive learning. Our platform is not just about understanding new concepts; it is a transformative journey that uses VR in education to simulate real-world applications and consequences in a controlled, virtual environment. Nice words, but what are we trying to say? QuesVR is ideal to use to present difficult situations in a safe and controlled environment.",
