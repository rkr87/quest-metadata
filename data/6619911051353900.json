        "description": "Laser Limbo is an AR battle game compilation. It transforms homes, offices, or entire floors into unique AR multiplayer arenas that make perfect use of every square meter of space as they wrap around any obstacle. Most of what players see is pass-through reality, which is augmented only by a few virtual pixel-style elements, like avatar vests that merge with the real body without completely covering it. Laser Limbo offers a diverse range of game modes that cater to different player preferences: from the energetic Coin Chase, to the strategic Team Puzzling, and the bullet-time Shooter, which can be played solo or in co-op against enemies, or versus other players. All game modes incorporate laser traps that players must avoid crossing, making thoughtful strategy and mindful movement essential for achieving victory. And with the included map editor you can create different maps to create new game scenarios in your home. \n\n",
