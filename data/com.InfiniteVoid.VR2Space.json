        "description": "If you're anything like me, then you've been dreaming about traveling to space since you can remember. But if you're not an astronaut, and you don't happen to be sitting on a mountain made of money, then this simply won't happen by sitting around and waiting.  Fewer than 600 people have ever travelled to space.  Lucky them... but what about the rest of us? This software is about enabling us, the remaining 99.999992%, to get that experience.  \n\nThis is a made for VR experience that uses real world HD video footage to recreate the experience of flying to an altitude of 30 km above the surface of the earth on a floating platform.  An immersive VR environment allows users to warp to set altitudes above the earth, and return to the ground by jumping off of the floating platform.\n\nSoftware Features:\n\n-  57 minutes of immersive spherical HD video content\n-  Interactive VR environment\n-  Stereophonic sound\n-  Real-time rotation compensation of the cameras",
