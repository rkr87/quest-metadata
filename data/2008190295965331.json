This can be useful in desperate situations.\n\nNEW ITEMS AND VENDORS\n* Books: added some books that increase your experience allowing you to start at higher level up to 15th level.\n* Added a second vendor before starting the game, this vendor will escalate with your best run! (e.g. you reached depth 30 the vendor will have loot for depth 30)\n\nFIXES\n* Lots of bug fixes!\n\nEnjoy!"
