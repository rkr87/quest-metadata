        "description": "IDEA B is a 7 track music album created to experiment with the idea of navigable VR music videos. Each song has its own simple, scene with mountains, plains, and some also have positional audio. You choose your own flight paths through the scenes, so in some songs you are steering yourself through the visuals in the scene, but also through the song's audio, passing birds with guitars or string instruments attached to them. \n\nNote: This experience will be different for every person depending on the flight paths they choose. This is a rapidly evolving exploration of navigable VR music formats. Written feedback about your experience, the paths you chose that were good, or thoughts on the possibilities for this format, are all very welcome. The idea would be to build out the concept with studio recorded music and AAA graphics.",
