        "description": "Wentworth VR is a ground breaking interactive cinematic virtual reality experience. Itâ€™s the official extension of the award winning TV series Wentworth.\n\nAs a new prisoner at Wentworth, you must find your feet and figure out who to trust in this dangerous new environment.\nThe previous occupant of your cell committed suicide in mysterious circumstances, and the J-Block crew are on the warpath about stolen gear. \n\nWhile trying to navigate complex prison politics, you must also try to piece together your own past - and what you did to get put in here. Are you ready to be locked up?\n\nNOTE: Wentworth VR needs 1GB free to successfully install. If you are having issues installing the app with an error of 'download failed', this may be due to not enough free space on your device.",
