        "description": "Have you ever wanted to go inside a piece of music and look around? Welcome.\n\nWelcome to the first-ever interactive VR symphony, where you will experience music as a 3D entity that moves around you. Choose your path around an orchestral galaxy of musical streams and marvel at the once invisible waves of music as they pulsate around you like a flock of starlings painting patterns in the sky. \n\nRecorded by the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, Brian Baumbusch's album-length composition is both visceral and therapeutic, hypnotic and deeply emotional. In this orchestra of clarinets, oboe, violins, viola, cello, double bass, piano, vibraphone, harp and guitar, you will be able to choose what instruments you wish to hear at any point throughout the symphony, dividing space and time like the many-worlds theory of quantum physics. \n\nDrawing from minimalism, classical music, and even Balinese gamelan music, Baumbusch's music is celebrated for being \"inconspicuously complex\" (Other Minds), \"intense, simmering, and arresting\" (NY Times) and \"maddeningly beautiful\" (The Washington Post).\n\nFly around the stage of this 3D album and the spatial audio will immerse you in a true science fiction, where each decision splits time into a new universe: polytempo music.",
