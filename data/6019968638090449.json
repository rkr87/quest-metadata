        "description": "Your goal is to destroy all bricks and enemies. Collect dropped power-ups but make sure not to miss a ball. Swing your hand to hit the ball just like in Air Hockey.\n\nEnemies are trying to shoot your VR head, which takes the challenge to a new level. Dodge bullets or reflect them into the enemy.\n\nFeatures:\nAdvanced boss fights: Some bosses are weak at the back, others can't be hit by the ball, etc. Each boss requires a unique approach to defeat it.\n\nIn-game level editor \nTry out your ideas. Full VR, no need to leave the game or use a mouse.\n\nAir Hockey: additional game mode with few setups and exciting power-ups.\n\nFlexible difficulty: 8 gameplay modifiers and 5 game difficulties are available. Play in your own style.\n\nQuick room setup: mega easy to calibrate room. Just hold one button to set direction and table height. Several seconds to do!",
