        "description": "Hidden Fortune is an adventurous treasure hunt through a virtual world of enchantment, with Chapter One: Outcast Cove now free to play! Chapter Two: Shanty Seas is available through single purchase, and unlocks over two hours of new content, including Wands, Orbs, and areas to discover. As a sorcerer on a daring rescue mission, players must use their magic—cast with the Gear VR touchpad or controller—to explore the vivid world around them, and collect peculiar trinkets to aid in their quest. \n\nCast Your Magic: Tap the Gear VR or swing the Gear VR Controller to cast magic Orbs, capture trinkets, make charming new acquaintances, and solve tricky puzzles. \n\nEnter the Wands: These collectable magic devices enable seamless interaction with the virtual world. Orienting intuitively to your hand’s movements, each Wand has unique art and visual effects. \n\nNew Challenges: Each quest in Outcast Cove and Shanty Seas now offers three levels of difficulty to test your wizarding skill.",
