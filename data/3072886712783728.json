        "description": "Finding Victor is a VR escape room that tells the story of an Indigenous youth overcoming homelessness. Indigenous graffiti artist, Victor recently lost a close friend sending him into a downward spiral. As the player, you are a friend tasked with Finding Victor by solving clues and uncovering his journey back to support. Take a journey through 3 escape room style challenges where you collect objects, solve puzzles, and learn more about Victor and his fall from grace and rise to success. Finding Victor is visually compelling and includes real life scenarios experienced by those exposed to homelessness. It includes Indigenous musical artists, A Tribe Called Red, Straight Up Feather, G.Ruu, and Eekwol. Indigenous actors Telly James and Stacy Da Silva go on to lend their voices to facilitate the story. Finding Victor is a culmination of tradition and innovation through the lens of the modern Indigenous experience.",
