        "description": "Blair Witch: Oculus Quest Edition is a story-driven psychological horror game based on the cinematic lore of Blair Witch. As Ellis, a former police officer with a troubled past, join the search for a missing boy in the iconic Black Hills Forest near Burkittsville, Maryland.\n \nWhat starts as an ordinary investigation soon will make you confront your darkest nightmares - and an ominous force known as the Blair Witch. But you’re not going in alone: your trusty K-9 sidekick, Bullet, is by your side. He’s your eyes, ears, and nose in these treacherous and terrifying woods.\n \nThe game has been rebuilt for Oculus Quest to offer a uniquely immersive and horrifying VR experience. With environments redesigned for more interactivity, new Bullet mechanics - such as gesture commands, actual hand-based petting and fetching - and additional creature encounters, you will experience the eerie atmosphere of the Black Hills Forest like never before.\n \nThese cursed woods will awaken your darkest fears.",
