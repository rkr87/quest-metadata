        "description": "• 8.5/10 - Road to VR \n• Made With Unity showcase 2016 \n\nIn a Galaxy far, far away… Ditch the golf clubs, because this planetary physics puzzler is like no other.\n\nSurvey mini-planets from the sky and defy gravity as you work your way through tricky terrain in as few shots as possible. Will you play it safe, or launch your ball into orbit chasing a hole-in-one?\n\nVR brings a whole new perspective to aiming, and with simple one-touch controls, anyone can get into the game. Swipe up and down to change the angle of your hit, and tap to shoot – it’s that easy! – but scoring under par will challenge even the best.\n\nBegin with Pleasant Hills and enjoy a mellow course with a pastoral vibe. Then take it up a notch and test your skills on Frosty Brimstone with its challenges inspired by puzzlers and platformers.\n\nNot enough you say? Take off the training wheels and turn on Pro mode!\n\n“One of those games that just put a smile on my face the second it started.”",
