The VR Fire Trainer Application includes multiple fire types, various 3D-environments, different types of extinguishers and extinguisher agents. Lots of different training programs that will suit the fire training you will perform. Measuring the users training performance in each fire scenario, how much the fire spread, how much of the extinguisher was used and how much smoke the user inhales.
