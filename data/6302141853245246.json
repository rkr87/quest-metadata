Consequently, we need to include the SPEAKING exam, which involves recording audio for evaluation purposes. I need to write a note explaining why I am requesting these permissions. Here's the note in English:\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO: This permission is essential to enable recording audio during practice sessions. Students can simulate the speaking section of the IELTS exam, allowing them to assess their performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\nandroid.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS: This permission enables us to adjust audio settings within the application, ensuring optimal recording quality and a seamless user experience.\n\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: These permissions are necessary for storing and retrieving recorded audio files. This functionality allows students to review their practice sessions and track their progress over time.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO, android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO, android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION, and android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGE: These permissions are used to access media files, such as audio recordings, videos, and images, stored on the device. This enables students to manage their practice materials efficiently within the app\n\nRegarding the application, it is an educational app for teaching English language for free, and its purpose is not profit-oriented. If the goal were profit, we would have added in-app purchases.\n\nAs for the recent comments, a function has been added to reset the player when they reach a certain distance. We have also adjusted the game's quality and optimized its performance."
