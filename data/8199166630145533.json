        "description": "Okay, by ‘shake’ we mean ‘blow up’. Bombaroom enables you to fight epic battles on the rug, sofa or anywhere else you fancy.\n\nIt’s all thanks to Meta Quest, seamlessly blends computer-generated things – in this case, cannons and targets – with the physical world, enabling you to shoot cartoon cannonballs at your sofa or lob munitions around the lawn.\n\nIt starts simply with a cannon and a single target. But that’s just to get you used to the controls – before long you’ll be trying to blow up pirate ships and castles.\n\nIt’s particularly amusing when people are walking past, completely unaware of the carnage taking place just a few feet away, or when you manage to place your enemy on something impractical such as a wobbly hedge.\n\nBombaroom is about aiming and getting the right amount of power behind your shot, and that means it’s both easy to pick up and hard to get really good at.\n\nIt’s a great way to mix a little destructive pleasure into your reality – just don’t worry too much about that castle that’s sprouted up in your kitchen.\n\nFeatures:\n• Intuitive controls for seamless gameplay\n• Face a variety of challenging enemies\n• Master straightforward rules across 30 captivating levels\n• Eye candy graphics\n• Take your time and activate slow motion with just one tap",
