        "description": "Team up with your friends and embark on a heart-pumping, zombie-blasting adventure in The Flip! This cooperative social VR shooter takes you to the edge of sanity as you blast your way through dawdling shufflers and giant nanotech-infused zombified tanks!\n\nFlip City has been overrun by the undead, and it’s up to you to fight through hordes of zombies as you take down Kreep’s Fiends. Get to the chopper in time for extraction, but try not to leave your friends behind!\n\nThe Flip drops you and three friends right in the middle of the action. Using Future Tech Games’ revolutionary BodyCount technology, you’ll see more zombies starving for your brains than ever before! Grab an arsenal of weapons by blasting open the caches scattered throughout the city containing shotguns, SMGs, grenade launchers and more to take on the overwhelming hordes!\n\nCommunication is key in The Flip, with built-in voice chat allowing for seamless coordination among your group. Work together to survive and progress through the game’s continuously revolving mission roster.\n\nDesigned for anyone to pick up and play, The Flip focuses on social, drop-in/drop-out gameplay. Grab your guns and team up for an adrenaline-fueled co-op experience you’ll want to repeat time and time again.\n\nThe Flip is a no-nonsense zombie blastfest, and you’re on the VIP list! Head to the fully 3D lobby to customise your avatar and meet with your friends before launching headfirst into an onslaught of undead mayhem!",
