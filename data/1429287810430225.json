Discover a virtual world which is already being offered in theme parks worldwide. Ride your favourite rollercoaster again or re-live exciting events as often as you wish – in virtual reality (VR). \nThe exciting recordings make it seem as if you were actually at the centre of the action.\nAs a further feature, you can buy tickets for the journey with the Alpenexpress Coastiality in Europa-Park directly in this app. Do you want another goody? When you buy a ticket for the Alpenexpress Coastiality via this app, its 360° video in this app will be activated for you at no cost.
