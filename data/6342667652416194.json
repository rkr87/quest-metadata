        "description": "Contour helps you bring digital art to life. Whether you're an artist or not, you can create superb drawings like a pro: simply upload image files to your Quest using a MAC or PC, resize and place your artwork atop your real world canvas, and start drawing !\n\nIt uses the Quest 2 / Quest 3 cameras - aka passthrough - to overlay digital artwork on top of a real life surface to easily create outlines for your art before starting the actual paint job.\n\nAs passthrough can be quite blurry - especially on Quest 2 - Contour isn't meant for precise drawing or finishes, and is better suited for sketching and outlining relatively large artwork (e.g. wall painting, signage...) before starting the actual paint job.\n\nTo import your own artwork:\n1. Create transparent PNG files, 1024 * 1024 (or above), with white outlines, using your preferred image editor.\n2. Plug your headset into your computer using USB C and put your PNG files into the `Android/data/com.DDXR.Contour/files` folder. Mac OS users will need a free 3rd party software, such as Android File Transfer or SideQuest.\n3. Restart the app, and you should see your files in the artwork menu.",
