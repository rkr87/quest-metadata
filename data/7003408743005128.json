        "description": "One hundred years ago the Federation Galactica fell in a great calamity.\n\nThe sentient races of the galaxy parted ways, and petty warlords took control of the great hyperspace gates.\n\nNow your world is dying. Invaders from the Outer Rim have devastated the last of the frontier outposts. You must find the last survivors of Fleet Command and liberate your sector.\n\nMOTION CONTROLS\n\nRogue Stargun features the most immersive virtual cockpit ever developed, with virtual hands for interacting with cockpit controls such as the flight stick, targeting system, reactor core, and even swappable weapons.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN\n\nWith over 24 carefully crafted missions, you will be flying through some of the most varied environments yet seen in a VR-first starfighter sim. Zip through canyons to take down enemy missile batteries, fly under the shields of enemy capital ships to take down their guns, bomb enemy mechanized ground walkers on an icy world, perform a daring raid on a space pirate den -- the variety is endless.\n\nUNIQUE STARFIGHTERS\n\nDo you go with the slow but heavily armored Tornado with its adjustable bombing sight and rear turret or the fast but lightly armored Meteor with its twin flak cannons and secret \"rear fuel dump blaster\"? There are 5 unique ships in this game, each with their own surprises. Each fighter is additionally equipped with a secondary swappable weapon, with over 50 such unique weapons that can be picked up from powerups, making every single playthrough a unique experience!",
