Sorry, this app is not available at this time.\n\nMagic: The Gathering - First Virtual Reality Art Exhibition Is Open!\n\nA virtual art exhibition is taking place in Towashi, the biggest city in Kamigawa. This setting is central to the latest Magic: The Gathering set “Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty” released on February 18th. This huge cityscape has been fully rendered in VR based on set design concept art.\n\nFeaturing 200 exhibits that explore the rich art of Kamigawa, the exhibition includes cards designed by 83 artists, behind-the-scenes material from the World Guide, original animation from Japan, and a special experience of bringing a card to life. \n\nAll exhibitors are top artists, including Tetsuo Hara (the manga artist of “Fist of the North Star”), Yoji Shinkawa (the art director of Kojima Productions Co., Ltd.), and Katsuya Terada (the character designer of “Kamen Rider W”).",
