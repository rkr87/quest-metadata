        "description": "Pebble Graphics is an experimental VR app that lets you experience programming in a new and exciting way. You can manipulate objects in 3D space and create programs that draw geometric patterns. You can also control the execution of your programs and visualize changes to Pebbles the dog and the scene around her. You can move forward and backward in time, and zoom in and out of different levels of abstraction. You can also see the execution history of your programs as a 3D visualization.\n\nPebble Graphics is designed for anyone who wants to learn about programming and explore new spatial interfaces for coding. You can learn the basics of programming logic, syntax, and control structures, and apply them to create intricate drawings. You can also experiment with different parameters and see how they change the output of your programs. Pebble Graphics is a fun and creative way to discover the power and beauty of programming in VR.\n\nPebble Graphics is created by an independent developer who loves VR and programming, and wants to share this passion with others. Start your VR coding adventure today!\n",
