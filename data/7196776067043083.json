        "description": "Amatrol's VR Smart Factory - Allen-Bradley (VR870-AB) creates a digital twin of Amatrolâ€™s three-cart Mechatronics training system that can be explored virtually via a Meta Quest 3 VR headset. Users can observe the operation of the system that assembles a working industrial directional control valve, including pneumatic pick and place feeding, go/no-go gauging/quality inspection (height and orientation verification), and automated inventory/parts storage.\n\nIn addition to observing the system in action, users can also interact with the virtual system, performing a variety of skills, such as: adjusting air pressure regulators for cylinders and vacuum generators; adjusting the ultrasonic sensor that regulates height measurement; viewing system information on the HMI screen; and adding parts to the gravity feeder. Several of these actions can also be performed via shortcuts using the left hand gaze controller on the VR headset.\n\nPlease note that the Amatrol VR Smart Factory - Allen-Bradley app is intended for use by educational institutions and businesses. To use the software, you must have an activation code purchased from Amatrol. If your organization is interested in purchasing activation codes for your educational institution or business, please reach out to Amatrol at https://amatrol.com/our-story/contact-us/",
