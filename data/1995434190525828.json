Generally, since the last hotfix, the ratio of p2p to relay connections has returned to pre new UI update. \n\t-AI free hit: users are reporting that their free hit AI is not playing at the level set in the free practice UI. We are not able to replicate this ourselves, but we have some leads. If you are experiencing this consistently, please reach out to us. \n\t-the game occasionally gets into a bad state where the frame rate drops significantly during a match.
