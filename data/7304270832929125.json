        "description": "The VR4VET Blue Sector VR app simulates an area of a fjord with several fish cages, a feeding station, a fish health and welfare station, and a fish processing facility. The users can experience situations representing typical workplaces in the aquaculture and fish processing industries, such as feeding salmon in multiple cages, inspecting fish for injuries and diseases, and sorting, cutting, and packaging fish in a factory.\nThe application can be used as a supplementary material for the end users integrated into the career guidance and vocational education practice. When in the application, the user takes the role of a trainee at various workplaces in the blue economy sectors, those related to the oceans, seas and coasts. The user is introduced to the professions and can engage in typical workplace tasks.\nThe app features:\n- Fish feeding station, where the user can observe salmon in three fish cages using a special underwater camera, adjust the feeding intensity to keep the fish well fed without wasting the food, and get feedback on their performance.\n- Fish welfare station, where the user can observe a typical procedure in aquaculture when a sample of fish is checked for diseases and injuries. The user can perform the check and get feedback on their performance.\n- Fish processing facility, where the user can observe how the salmon is received, sorted, processed, packaged and shipped for delivery. The user can perform several typical tasks and get feedback on their performance.\n",

It can be opened by pressing the Y-button on the left hand controller.\n\n## Changed:\n- We reworked the virtual tablet so that  the player can more easily keep track of the progress and the current objectives. The user interface of the tablet is also simplified. The updated tablet is now available in the fish factory scenario with the corresponding skills, tasks, subtasks and steps.\n- We updated the logic of the fish behavior in the fish feeding scenario. The fish will swim upwards only when they are hungry and the feeding intensity is set to high.\n- The food wastage UI bar does not appear completely empty when there is zero waste in the fish feeding scenario.\n\n## Fixed:\n- We fixed the issue where the hands would stretch when grabbing objects in the fish factory scenario.\n- We fixed the issue where live fish never appeared in the bleeding station of the factory."
