        "description": "Rave Gazebo uses your arm gestures to change both the music and the visuals of your environment. Flail wildly and hear the music keep up with your sick moves, and let the visual stimulus wash over you. The whole world is dancing to the music, and you should too. Feel the power of directing an experience desperately waiting for your input.\n\nFeaturing six songs from indie artists this album is the first of its kind, pushing the boundaries of how non-musicans can express themselves musically through dance.\n\nTrack list:\nRave Gazebo - Greg_OS and Ratface\nCondiment Tie Dye - Greg_OS\nAntiparticle Lobster - Ratface\nQuadra Section - Stin\nMoonglade Express - Falling Starheart\nXylitol Isomalt - exjaynine",
