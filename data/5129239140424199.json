You can now choose between taking on the enemy with a Light-Cannon, or dual wielding Plasma Pistols.\n*New Powerups!  To best serve our new weapons we also have some new powerups to be gained.\n*Improved power up Ammo collection.  Ammo can still be picked up as in previous versions, alternatively you can simply walk over it to get the powerup.\n*Improved Grenade pickup.  Grenades will now float around chest height making them easier to grab in the heat of battle.\n*More frantic gameplay.  The levelling system has been adjusted; things will ramp up far quicker than before.\n\n-Bug Fixes\n*Game bounds.  It is no longer possible to hide from the enemy by sitting outside their reach."
