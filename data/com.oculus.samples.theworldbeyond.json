        "description": "Discover an engrossing new world of mixed reality, where your play space merges with a virtual landscape. Interact with Oppy and The World Beyond using your hands and voice.  Use a magic flashlight to find energy orbs in your own room, hidden behind Passthrough. Grab them with your hands, tossing them into your space as Oppy navigates around your furniture and room. Use voice commands to ask Oppy to jump or come, or just say hi!  Feed her energy orbs so she can return home!\n\nThe World Beyond is a 5 minute tech demo of Presence Platform features. As such, a full game experience should not be expected; it's instead meant to inspire developers to build mixed reality experiences!\n\nIf you get a black screen while running The World Beyond, please update and restart your headset.",
