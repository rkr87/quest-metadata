        "description": "December event is live! Read post below for details.\n\nHo Ho Ho! It's Santa here, and I've got a big Christmas challenge for you! My workshop's a bit of a mess, and presents are popping out all over the place â€” right into your house!\n\nYou'll grab gifts from moving belts and pack them as fast as you can. It's simple: gifts come in, you pack them up, and together we make sure Christmas is ready to go!\n\nThe game is easy to play but can get pretty zippy, like reindeer on a gingerbread sugar rush. But hey, that's part of the fun! It's all about quick hands, a sharp eye, and a heart full of holiday spirit.\n\nNo scores, no timers, just you saving the day one gift at a time. There's also a personal gift shop for you to treat yourself to some home decoration, like a lovely Christmas tree! So, what do you say? Grab your Quest and make some room â€” let's see those present-packing skills in action!\n\nCheers and chuckles,\nSanta ðŸŽ…âœ¨",
