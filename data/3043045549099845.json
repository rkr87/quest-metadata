The entire experience runs more smoothly and evenly across the board.\nThe Kybele have been shoring up their reliquary and it should now be easier to understand what Shamans can trade there. We held numerous talks over the last days and we have now convinced them to dismiss their annoying habit of sticking item cards into your hands after leaving the reliquary.\nWe also have added general quality of life improvements.\nThe Astral Teleporter technology is key to our success and we are working round the clock to provide you and your fellow Shamans with future updates. Stay tuned because we will be in contact again soon.\nBend a beam!"
