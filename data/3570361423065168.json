        "description": "The virtual reality work experiences place the learner in real life scenarios where they can see how members of the health and social care sector spend part of their working day. \n\nAlex has broken his wrist at school. Follow his journey from his first visit to the doctor, through his radiology appointment where his arm is x-rayed, through to his arm being put in a cast.\n\nMrs Brown Sr. has experienced palpitations and has called an emergency paramedic who runs standard checks before taking her to the hospital in an ambulance where she undergoes an ECG test. Safely back home we meet Mrs Brownâ€™s social carer and finally follow her to the pharmacy to collect her newly prescribed medication.\n\nMr Brown has recently been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and is meeting a dietitian who will help him understand how simple lifestyle changes can help him. Watch as they discuss food groups and the benefits of a balanced diet and as the dietitian recommends exercise and staying active.",
