        "description": "Have you ever wondered what happens inside the mind of a participant who is testing his knowledge on live TV? You have seen it and knew the answers to the questions but you weren’t in his or her shoes to answer them… Well, now it is time to test your skills and fulfill your destiny!\n\nWe are happy to welcome you to the Billionaires Show, a show held within a space station, where you get to answer 30 questions in order to be part of the Billionaires Club and engrave your name forever to the game.\n\nYou get 4 superpowers to help you answer different questions from all kinds of fields such as history, science, art, sports, space, movies, and more.\n\nWe are aware that every TV Show needs a sponsor, and since we wanted to give something in return to our players, we have created a special place for the “extraterrestrials”, the ones who are knowledge-driven and highly competitive.\n\nIf you manage to answer all 30 questions and be part of the Billionaires Club, you will be treated as one. You’ll get to promote your Oculus profile for 10 days to other players who are testing their skills in the show at any time...for free. And if that is not enough, you can always sponsor again by investing your billions and promoting what is valuable to you!\n\nOur goal is to give all players the most realistic experience that a real-life TV show could give, to entertain and learn more within the journey.\n\nFor now, we have only one question: Are you ready to become a billionaire?",
