The Dynamic Table reacts dynamically to the size and rotation of the model.\n- Added controls for adjusting the rotation of the model and the height of the Dynamic Table inside the Tools menu.\n\nImmersive Mode\n- Introduced a new Skybox environment that mirrors the color settings of the default SketchUp 2023 Desktop template.\n- Added an infinite Grid that represents the Ground and is aligned in height with the skybox’s horizon.\n- Added the ability to Pan, Orbit, and Zoom In/Out using the grip buttons of the controllers as described below.\n- Added the “Jump” option under the Tools menu.\n- Introduced the option to adjust the viewing height.\n- Introduced the “Elevator” feature that enables the viewer to move up/down floors if a floor is identified above or below the current viewing point respectively. \n\nControls & Gestures\n- Enabled model or home environment pan via a single click of the grip button on either controller and moving the controller in any direction.\n- Enabled model zoom in/out via simultaneous click of grip buttons on both controllers and moving controllers together or apart.\n- Enabled model orbit and/or rotation via the simultaneous click of grip buttons on both controllers and moving controllers in opposite forward/backward directions.\n- Added the ability to teleport or enter immersive mode by tilting the controller’s thumbstick forward and releasing\n- Added the ability to rotate the view by tilting the controller's thumbstick sideways\n- Added the ability to move backward by tilting the controller's thumbstick backward.\n\nTools Panel\n- The Measurement tool allows for measurements to be taken in either Tabletop or Immersive modes.\n- Measurements can be displayed in various units accessible via the settings.\n- Measurements can be deleted individually or all at once.\n\nScenes\n- Added the Scenes tray that offers access to all Scenes saved in the .skp file. \n- Introduced Presentation Mode that removes all other UI and only displays a carousel strip with all the available Scenes in the model and allows fast navigation.\n- Scenes can also be visualized as Markers in either Tabletop or Immersive modes.\n\nTags\n- Introduced the Tags tray that lists all Tags saved in the SketchUp file.\n- Added option to control the visibility of each individual Tag.\n\nOutliner\n- Added the Outliner tray to offer access to the model organization tree the same way it does for SketchUp Desktop, Web, and Mobile.\n- Introduced the ability to select Groups or Components from the Outliner, which automatically opens an Entity Info window displaying information about the selected object, such as Object Definition, Assigned Tag, and its nesting location (What object it is contained in).\n- Added the ability to select objects with the controller directly in 3D space, which will also display the Entity info box.\n- Selecting objects either through the Outliner or directly in 3D space will highlight the objects and their potential instances in the Outliner as well as highlight their bounding box in 3D model space.  \n\nPerformance improvements\n- Improved the time that SketchUp models load by approximately 90% compared to previous versions.\n- Increased the amount of complexity of SketchUp models that can be loaded. The SketchUp Viewer for Meta Quest can now load SketchUp models of up to 100MB or models with up to 2.7M faces. These numbers are approximate as the complexity of a model is also related to other factors like the resolution of textures found in the materials applied to the surfaces of the model.\n\nKnown Limitations\n- 3D Warehouse integration has temporarily been removed from the application.\n- The Collaboration Beta feature has temporarily been removed from the application.\n- The Map View is no longer available.\n- Any Measurements taken in the VR Viewer app are not saved with the SketchUp file and are not persistent once the viewing session is terminated.\n- When panning in Immersive mode the model appears to be sinking into the ground’s infinite grid.\n- The app does not support loading files through the AR|VR Extension from SketchUp desktop clients.\n- The new VR Viewer version 3.0.1 application is currently available only through the Meta Quest store and only compatible with the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3 devices.\n"
