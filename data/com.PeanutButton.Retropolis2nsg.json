        "description": "*** Now available for early access! Grab the first episode and secure a season pass to all four thrilling episodes releasing later this year. Dive into the adventure today and become part of the Retropolis legend! ***\n\nThe story of Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye is set a year after the events depicted in The Secret of Retropolis, and continues the story of Philip Log, the hard-boiled robo-detective, and Jenny Montage, the automated femme fatale that just can’t keep herself out of trouble. Nonetheless, Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye welcomes new visitors to the city of robots, and can be experienced as its own miniseries. \n\nThe Retropolis series is a user-friendly VR experience built from the ground up to support effortless VR interaction. Using Philip Log’s extendo-arms, the player is able to collect items from afar, use them to overcome obstacles, and move the plot forward. On top of the first game’s mechanics, Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye features enchanted logic puzzles, new rotation mechanics, and movement between different environments, offering a more challenging adventure with a substantially longer playtime.\n\nEven though set in a post-apocalyptic cityscape inhabited only by robots, all 3D assets in Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye were hand painted by living and breathing human beings, making each environment a stunningly detailed piece of art. With improved graphics and character animation, returning to Retropolis is more jaw dropping than ever.\n",
