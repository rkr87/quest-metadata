        "description": "**Free for a limited time during Open Beta!**\n\nMega Fireball is the only mixed-reality game that turns your entire place into a playable space!\n\n**Mixed Reality Local Multiplayer**\n\nGrab a friend with a Quest device and play together in the same room or go solo against the AI in single-player mode. Slap, shoot, and smash the ball into the goal before your opponent to win! \n\n**Single Player**\n\nTake on our AI with several challenging tiers, practice up rookie, they know how to get around any room in your house!\n\n**One Goal, Many Shots**\n\nThere’s only one net, but plenty of referees, fireguys, power-ups that’ll get in your way! Fireguys will spread fire anywhere they touch including the ball! That’s cool, you know why? Because fireballs score double points my friend! \n\n**ADVANCED MODE**\n\nQuit the button mashing and use your controllers (or head) to punch balls into the goal. Or use your left trigger to shoot water balloons at your opponent. Whatever it takes to win!",
