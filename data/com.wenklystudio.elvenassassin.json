        "description": "Is there anything more epic than slaying hordes of orcs and dragons with a bow in Virtual Reality? When nothing comes to your mind, then you probably should try this. If you thought: \"Of course, slaying them with my friends online in co-op mode!\" then this is a matter of destiny.\n\nBECOME AN ELVEN ASSASSIN.\nTake a bow and kill hundreds of enemies that want to get into the elven town and destroy it. As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long-distance headshots.\n\nPIECE OF CAKE, THEN?\nNot really. The Orcs are running fast, they break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they get furious, their massive axe is thrown to splash your head into pieces. \n\nASSASSIN UNITED.\nUp to four assassins may unite to defend the town. Communicate using voice chat, but watch your language. \n\nDisclaimer: \nAny similarity to any other fantasy movie, game, or book is purely coincidental.",
