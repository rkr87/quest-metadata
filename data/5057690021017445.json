        "description": "The good news: Kill It With Fire VR gives you ultimate freedom to hunt down and murder spiders. With fire! And ninja stars. And rocket launchers. And a submachine gun. And a huge range of other weapons, too. Take on the role of an exterminator and destroy mankind’s most ancient and deadly eight-legged nemesis.\n\nThe bad news: It's SPIDERS. In VR. And there's a lot more of them then there is of you. Don't say we didn't warn you.\nBut you're not going in alone. You've got a huge arsenal of weapons and technology to help you do a little bit of population control. And if there’s a little collateral damage caused along the way? Well, it’s best to be SURE they're dead.\nFeatures:\n- Large arsenal of unique weapons and equipment\n- Eight different spider species\n- “Realistic” fire simulation system\n- Gratuitous chaos and destruction\n- Dozens of optional objectives\n- Loads of hidden upgrades\n- Battle in the Arachno-Gauntlet!\n- A secret ending?!?!
