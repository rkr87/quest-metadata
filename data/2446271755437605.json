        "description": "What makes the noises we can’t explain? Eight-year-old Lucy is convinced it’s wolves. Her family is not so sure.\n\nBut something has been stealing Mom’s jam, glitching Brother’s games, and howling over Dad’s music. Lucy desperately wants to warn them all, and she needs your help. Will you believe her?\n\nBecause when the wolves do, in fact, come out of the walls, it’s all over.\n\nHelp her discover what's hiding inside the walls of her house in this ~40 minute interactive fable based on the book by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. Capture proof with photographs, search for clues with a magnifying glass, and defend Lucy’s pig puppet. \n\nWinner of the 2019 Primetime Emmy® for Outstanding Innovation in Interactive Media.\n\nIf you are especially curious about Lucy and her world you can follow her on Instagram: @lucyandpigpuppet",
