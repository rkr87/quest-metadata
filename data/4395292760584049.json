Those who seek to unmake this world are desperate for the Glass she holds, and they’ll stop at nothing to claw it from her grasp. \n\nTo stand a chance, Quill will need a true partner by her side—and we hope that partner is you. With her, you’ll venture deep inside the hexed castle of the Arcane where dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel await.  \n\n**Reach into the World of Moss |** Your every action has even more meaning in Moss: Book II, as we take full advantage of today’s VR technology, letting you move objects, battle enemies, and manipulate the field of play as the key ally to our hero, Quill.\n\n**Adventure to Fantastic Places |** Travel to a lively world that hums with wonder and legend. Explore the castle where her uncle was held captive, caves beneath, snow covered mountain tops to the depths below filled with ancient artifacts, mysterious creatures, and sprawling views.\n\n**Form a Unique Bond |** Your abilities are complementary to Quill’s in an alliance for the ages. Combine classic, action-adventure controls with a world that responds to your touch. Solve puzzles, combat evil, and achieve victory together.\n\n**A Story Told Unlike Any Before |** From its opening pages, Moss: Book II continues to draw you into a first-of-its-kind fully immersive world of myth and magic.
