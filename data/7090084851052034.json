        "description": "This chess application uses MIXED REALITY to deliver the most realistic and authentic over-the-board chess playing experience yet. \n\nPlay with FRIENDS or AI\nYou are able to choose whether you want to play against your friends or against chess-AI's in various difficulties.\n\nFinally HAPTIC feedback\nThis application was developed with authentic interactions in mind.\nAfter table calibration your UI will be displayed on your real table transforming it to a huge smartscreen.\nAdditionally our experimental mode lets you play with a real chessboard thereby allowing the real haptic chess-playing experience, where you can feel all of your chess-pieces and move them naturally. \nControllers are never needed.\n\nPerfectly blending REALITY and VIRTUALITY\nThis app is located both in reality and virtuality. In MIXED REALITY you are still able to see your real surrounding. It is extended with digital elements such as your playing partner and his chess pieces. Depending on if you are playing with a physical chessboard and physical pieces these assets are either part of your reality or the digital virtuality.\n\nDue to the MIXED REALITY focus we recommend using the application with Quest Pro or Quest 3.",
