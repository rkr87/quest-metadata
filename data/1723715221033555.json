Throughout your journey through alien landscapes, a story will unfold.\n\nThe game holds an abstract aesthetic that has become characteristic for the studio through their earlier VR experiences such as APEX and Surge. Lively colours, intuitive gameplay and interesting level design set the tone for KIN, in which the player moves through the world as a mysterious, tiny girl with big hair clad in a bright dress. Defeating enemies and solving puzzles, she leaps from platform to platform, travelling through different landscapes.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nOriginal setting and storytelling\nExciting combat and challenging puzzles\nGuide your character through beautifully crafted landscapes in virtual reality",
