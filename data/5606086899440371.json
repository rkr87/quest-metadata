        "description": "NORN is an indie fantasy VR experience, based on an ancient traditional Norwegian legend. This complex metaphorical lore takes place in Brain, where Civil war has struck, and the dark forbidding figure of Hel is on the rise to power. She has stolen the Mindâ€™s Will and is about to overthrow the government with her Army of Stress Hormones. Imagination is slowly fading, and time is running out. Our heroine Gullveig must embark on an epic journey with a dangerous Quest: to free the Will from enslavement in the reptilebrain and save the State of Fantasy. But to find the key before Hel does, she will need your help...\n\nThis is the first chapter of a series based upon a Norwegian legend, one of power, overcoming adversity, and knowing thyself. Enter this unique and ancient story, never before told like this. And don't forget to tilt you gaze upwards, towards the cosmic skies -- handpainted by the artist herself. \n\nNORN Chapter 1 won the Grand Jury Award and the Best XR Art & Culture award of the Nordic VR Forum & VRINN Awards in 2021.",
