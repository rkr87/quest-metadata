        "description": "From 1967 until 1985, guests at Disneyland had the opportunity to ‚Äùtravel into the incredible universe found within a tiny fragment of a snowflake.\"  The attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space, sought to use the tools of cinematic set design to explore the lessons of science, with massive structures representing water molecules and elaborate projection revealing the microscopic world of the atom.  The ride was developed during Walt Disney's final years, when he repeatedly explored how the tools of filmmaking might be repurposed to explore worlds beyond cinema in his theme park. Adventure Thru Inner Space was groundbreaking not only in introducing the Omnimover and by creating an attraction almost wholly focused on backgrounds (with no characters except for the onboard narration) but in the way it arranged dramatic, themed space toward educational goals.",
