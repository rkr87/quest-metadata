        "description": "Catapult and makeSEA.com allow you to share and collaborate live using content you produce. You can mix many sources, at any scale, and save every collaboration space layout for future recall. \n\nSharing and collaborating is as easy as:\n1.  Create a Project at makeSEA.com\n2.  Save any 3D content from your favorite 3D creative tool in GLB, STL, OBJ, or FBX or MP4 (video), or other compatible format to your Project's Assets collection\n3.  Add Team Members if you like,  and set your preferred sharing mode: Private, Public, etc. (!IMPORTANT Team members cannot see assets in Draft mode).\n4.  Launch Catapult (this application), login with your makeSEA credentials, and choose a Project to join the Project’s collaboration space. Note that only Team Members can join Projects marked Private.\n\nFor detailed instructions and release notes please see http://www.makesea.com/how-to",
