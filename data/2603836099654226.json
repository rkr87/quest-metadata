These are the ones that include a character portrait. This way the player can turn them off while still getting quest progress notifications.\nFixed a visibility issue when riding Mereret from the Sobek Bathhouse area back to the canal.\nFixed an issue around the calculation of map completion on the Great Sand Sea.\nRemoved a screeching sound on some grapples in the Red Chasm.\nIn the Blistering Vents, if you died after the Ragnarök area, you would always be sent back to this stone forcing unintended re-traversing.\nFixed a corrupt save problem if you quit during the AW1 recap.\nChanged the save file order of operation to complete writing a new save and then overwrite the old one. We previously immediately started overwriting the old save which made it susceptible to corruption if something outside of the game interrupted the operation."
