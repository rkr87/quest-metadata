        "description": "Co-Operative Multi-player and Single-player Asteroid Hauler simulator designed from the ground up for Room Scale Virtual Reality. Completely customize, maintain and repair the controls and systems of your ship using 100s of interconnecting components that fully simulate power and data distribution. \n\nThe year is 2150. You’ve successfully landed a job working for one of the many mining facilities stationed in the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. Using a company issued Asteroid Hauler, your job is to search for mineral rich asteroids and tow them back to the primary mining facility for further processing.\n\nBe warned, this trivial sounding job will push you to your creative engineering limits. The asteroid belt is extremely dangerous, radiation and cosmic rays will continuously degrade the components of your ship. Over the course of your employment you will need to become intimately familiar with how all ship systems operate and fit together so that you can rearrange, rewire and reprogram them as they fail around you. You’ll need to get creative to survive and get your payload back to the primary mining facility.\n\nAll components can be connected using red cables which simulate power distribution and green cables which simulate data flow from user input and various sensors.",
