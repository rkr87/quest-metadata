(Expect tweaks to this in the future)\n- New model for Loot crates (they were using an Ammo Box model, which is confusing because they mainly drop Credits)\n- Loot Crates can now drop Health in addition to Credits. \n- WeaponModStation (Chest with \"?\" over it) UI now rotates to face the player.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Fixed issue where enemies would sometimes never die.\n- Fixed issue where rooms visually disappeared and infinite space was visible.\n- Fixed issue where sometimes you could drop the pistol and no longer continue your run\n- Fixed issue where enemies could shoot through door frames\n- Fixed Shield hand position when in Lefty mode.\n- Fixed reload button in Lefty Mode\n- Fixed issue where sometimes there would be invisible walls blocking you."
