        "description": "Become part of an elite special forces unit and use real-world CQB (Close Quarters Battles) tactics to breach doors, clear rooms, and defeat the enemy threat.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Play Solo or with up to 4 friends in cross-play supported coop between PCVR and Meta Quest 2 players.\n\n• Utilize an arsenal of weapons, scopes, sight attachments, explosives, and equipment.\n\n• Consider physics-based bullet drop and time-to-hit for a more challenging sim.\n\n• Use stealth to sneak up behind enemies with a silent knife kill or butt-stock hit to the head. Or go head-to-head against AI enemies that will take cover and attempt to flank your position.\n\n• Randomized Enemy positions make each play-through an unknown challenge.\n\n• Non-linear, asymmetrical maps give players an endless variety in how they choose to infiltrate and complete missions. Enter buildings through doors, climb ladders to reach rooftops or climb through windows. The choice is yours.\n\n• Train hard in 2 variations of the Room Randomizer killhouse (complete with overhead catwalk), solo or with your friends. Lobby hosts have full control to add enemies, hostages, targets, and randomized rooms.\n\n• Test your skills against other players in multiplayer 5v5 PvP\n\nTactical Assault VR is currently an early-access release.",

We do not exist. A billionaire philanthropist has been secretly funding the enemy. Eliminate the High-Value Target, upload the contents of his laptop, and clear the mansion of all hostiles.\n\n• Updated Avatar Uniforms with various colors, flannel, and camo options\n• Added Female Avatar (options are currently limited.

A team-killing player is automatically kicked and booted to the Main Menu if their TK reaches 3. Available in both Coop and PvP.\n• Added: TeamKills now tracked in the players list\n• Added: Offset(canted/angled) Sights\n• Added multiplayer \"Mission Start\" countdown for Coop lobby. When the host presses \"Start Game\", all players will die and become spectators for 10 seconds before the mission is loaded to prevent any additional RPCs from being sent.\n• Added \"Current Players on Server\" counter when connected to multiplayer. See how many players are currently active throughout the entire server.\n• Added LOADING image with load percentage counter. Replaces previous \"...LOADING...\" text\n• Improvements to Enemy Ai aim, shoot and animations sync across the network\n• Added Bomb Defusal as an Objective Modifier (only available in Incoming Storm, Sever Snake, and Trident Lightning)\n• Added check to see if a player's custom avatar selection exists for players who are missing avatar body parts (ie missing face etc).\n\nChanges:\n• Updated Multiplayer Lobby with indoor shooting range and briefing room\n• Enemies will decide to continuously fire and hold their position or do a short burst fire before moving to cover\n• Enemies will hold their cover longer unless they have a clear shot of you and no obstructions are in the way\n• Enemies can now maneuver around in a crouched state.

The grabbed objective will now drop if the player holding it leaves\n• Fixed: If a player leaves and has another player's item in their holster or pouch, the item will now be released and drop the item to the ground. Previously, magazines and items would get stuck mid-air and weren't grabable.\n• Fixed player who is downed and their avatar is a ragdoll, when a New player joins, the ragdolled avatar will sync for the new player\n• Fixed grenades not destroying for newly joined players\n• Fixed players getting flashed when joining a room\n• Fixed Multiplayer Lobby breach charges not destroying for new players if detonated and attached to a door.\n"
