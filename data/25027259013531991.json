        "description": "Step back in time and immerse yourself in a unique blend of history and technology with our groundbreaking app that brings Victorian stereoscopic photographs to life. The images were taken over 100 years ago using similar techniques to those used today resulting in images that can be viewed in full 3D VR. Meticulously hand-restored and aligned for optimal viewing comfort, these captivating images will take you on a mesmerizing journey through four distinct scenes: a Wild West frontier, a bustling cityscape, an industrial dockside, and the intimate setting of a Victorian home.\n\nSee iconic scenes such as workers precariously balanced on girders high above New York - or experience the feeling of being a time traveler standing on a bustling Victorian street.\n\nEach scene is designed to transport you to a different environment, allowing you to explore the intricate details of these historical images in a way that was never before possible. As you navigate through the galleries, the immersive audio and surrounding scenery enhances the experience, drawing you deeper into the rich tapestry of the past. Original text from the Stereocards accompanies the images to provide historical context. \n\nThe app now features 63 carefully curated images, with more to be added in future free updates.\n\nWhether you're a history enthusiast, a lover of art and photography, or simply someone seeking a truly unique VR experience, our app offers something for everyone.",
