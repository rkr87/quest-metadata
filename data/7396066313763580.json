        "description": "We conducted an experiment on 100 chess players of different levels, with an elo rating from 1000 to 1800. During 5 weeks, the players played an average of 10 minutes a day of our master position mod with all the premium privileges with premium positions. After that period, the average improvement in elo rating was almost 200 points. We are proud of the achieved results and would like to thank our volunteers for their cooperation. Continue to develop your skills, with us.\nEver feeling that solving tactical puzzles would be interesting and fun, doesn't contribute to your game? Ever felt like your real-life games are not as dynamic and you are not losing because of missing flashy tactics but actually blundering \"normal\" moves?\nThe Reality Check is built with having your consistency and overall quality of playing fully random positions occurred in games on a top level, whether it contains tactics, strategy, or playing simple moves improving some of your pieces.\nChallenge yourself with a variety of playing modes and get your reality checked! Compared to having to play in positions that feel like a very specific set-up, with this application you will gain a very accurate evaluation and estimation of your playing strength!\nPlease let us know how it contributed to your game and help us in our mission to help you to become a better chess player!",
