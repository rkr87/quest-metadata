        "description": "Introduce:\nThis is a wonderful world, which is different from the world we live in. In this world, you can touch the stars in the sky, fly in the sky like a dream, use musical instruments, interact with the wonderful creatures in this world, and also cooperate with each other. Listen to your favorite music and vent your uneasy emotions. This is a game designed for people who yearn for freedom. It has no punishment mechanism and encourages you to explore the world.\n\n\nBackground:\nThe background of the game is set in the virtual dream created by players wearing VR headsets.\n\n\nDescribe:\nIn this dream world, many trees of hope have been cut down and destroyed, which was the dream that the owner of this dream once had.\n\nIn this dream world, a new seed of hope appears, and players need to plant this seed to help and protect its growth.\n\nIn the current game, you explore the conscious world of a frustrated child.\n\nIn the world of consciousness, you will meet the bread cloud, which is the perceptual, positive thought of this child, and you will also meet the octopus cloud, which represents the child, which is rational, conservative rationality. Rational thoughts will continue to swallow up perceptual thoughts, and you can Change the world of consciousness through the sound of the drum in your hands.",
