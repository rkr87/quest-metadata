Discover some of the most important innovations in automobile engineering, aeronautics, propeller technology and gearing in immersive Virtual Reality.\n\nExplore Fred’s workshop and see his designs and inventions come to life! Find out about his history and legacy, from the first British cars and motorboats to record-breaking engines and remarkable flying machines.\nBuild your own car at Fred’s workbench and test out different engines, suspension and parts to complete the challenges of the ‘Auto Engineer’ game.\n\nSelect the best wings, propellers and other elements for your plane and then pilot it through the rings to reach the finish in the ‘Flight’ challenge.\nTry and figure how different wing types change a glider’s flight path in ‘Aerodone’.\n\nSolve puzzles with 'Gears'! Use different gears and ratios to get the right amount of power to all the components in the gear box.",
