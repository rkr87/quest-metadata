Measurements are automatically visible to other users.\n- Easier Issue Creation: Create issues more intuitively and with fewer clicks.\n- Improved model load times and switching between 1:1 and workshop.\n\nWhat’s Fixed:\n- Fixed an issue that could cause some users to lose the ability to control visibility via the Model Tab.\n- Fixed several bugs that resulted in app crashes.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds:\n- Users may intermittently lose the ability to go to or gather specific users due to a known issue with certain permission roles.\n- Button to open/close and reposition the console may lose functionality if the user goes to the Home space and then returns to a Workshop. To resolve this, exit the app and re-enter it.\n- Some users with lower permissions may not see measurements created by those with higher permission levels.\n- Users may hang in blank space for an extended time when exiting the workshop after working with large data sets."
