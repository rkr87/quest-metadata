        "description": "What effect did the Fugitive Slave Law have on communities across the North before the Civil War? In this TimeSnap, players investigate the far-reaching consequences of the law by listening to historical figures, discovering primary sources, and asking probing questions. With evidence collected from three significant sites during the 1850s, players identify a range of effects, contextualize responses to the Fugitive Slave Law, and explain the lawâ€™s role in the deepening sectional crisis. TimeSnap is a 20-30 minute experience designed for use in high school American history classrooms and includes full lesson plans and materials from the project website. It also makes for a great standalone experience for history buffs of any age.",
