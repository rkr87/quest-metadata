        "description": "In this game, you have to run away. Different doors are blocking the way, that need to be unlocked to proceed as fast as possible. Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail.\n\nTo open a door, a puzzle is presented, where pieces of a key have to be rotated and merged together to open the door. The further you run, the more difficult the key puzzles become.\n\nThere are three different modes:\n\n* Normal Mode: Score is increasing the more you survive. It decreases the more you stay idle in a room without picking a door. There's a set amount of rooms to complete before reaching the end.\n* Endless Mode: Score increases with each room that is completed. There is no end to the amount of rooms presented.\n* Random Mode: Each door has a specific score as a reward when opened. Rooms and their rewards spawn at random.\n\nThe available benefits from the doors are:\n\n* Green doors: Increase running speed.\n* Purple doors: Increase lock-picking skills, which makes opening new doors easier.\n* Blue doors: Gives extra chances before losing.\n* Brown doors provide no direct benefit, apart from helping complete more rooms.",
