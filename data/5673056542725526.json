        "description": "# New Updates!ã€€Ver 1.06\nWe've received multiple reviews about an issue where users are unable to select workouts. Unfortunately, our development team has not been able to confirm the problem. However, we suspect that the difficulty in selection might be due to the system mistakenly detecting a drag action during selection attempts, which could lead users to perceive that they cannot make selections. We have addressed this assumption.\n\nIf you still experience problems with selecting workouts, we would appreciate it if you could send detailed feedback directly to the following email address:\n\nstore(at)strippers.jp\n\nThank you.\n\n--\n\n__Punch Fit is the answer to your exercise needs.\nFollow the example and punch and dodge for an easy and fun workout.\nLearn various combinations of punches, dodges, and rushes to make your play more exhilarating and pleasant.__\n\n## OVER 50 WORKOUTS\nEnjoy a workout that suits your needs in terms of time and difficulty.\nWe plan to add more and more new workouts in the future.\n\n## EXERCISE REWARDS\nExercise and earn drop points to get skin packs.\nYou can get over 100 skins.\n\n## EXCITING BACKGROUND MUSIC\nWe have prepared a variety of background music to match your workout.\nLet's get into the groove and have fun.",
