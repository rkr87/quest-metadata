effect, this hit effect's color depends on the color of the bullet\n\nThrowing improvements\n\t- Throwable items now are thrown correctly and keep the inertia from the hands and player.\n\t- Increased

option: enable or disable the easing of the movement in the spline for NPCs\n\t- Animation Module (New)\n\t\t· For playing NPC animations (only if they have (Lobb-e doesnt have animations yet))\n\t- Look At Module (New)\n\t\t· Created for exclusive look at interactions with the following options:\n\t\t\t· View target: you can set a point in the world, a fixed direction or the player head for making those npcs look at you\n\t\t\t· Rotation modes:\n\t\t\t\t· Continuous: makes the character move their head to look at the target, they can move the body too if they need until stopped\n\t\t\t\t· Single: pose the whole character for be looking straight to that target in a single shot, not continuous, it rotates the whole npc Holder\n\t- Module objects for npcs have been

far loot to come faster to you when raising your hand\n\nNow when in the tutorial you can just leave it by returning to the lobby (Tutorial will still loading each time you start the game, so we

period\n\t- Resolved issues with Greenlink causing links to disappear when removing a single node after reloading a level\n\t- Fixed cases where Greenlink nodes were arranged incorrectly after

measurements\n\t- Fixed issues with \"Retry\" and \"Restart Level\" buttons not appearing in built-in levels\n\t- Corrected hand rotations in the login scene\n\t- Resolved an issue that caused
