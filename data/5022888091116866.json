equator and ground global lights), giving levels much more customization\n\nNew enemy kill particles\n  - Enemy death particles now fit with the colors of the enemies\n  - Enemy death particles are now 3D\n  - Death particles now move in the direction of the last hit, killing enemies is muuuch more satisfying\n\nNew hit effect added for weapon attacks\n\t- Slash effects: each melee hit landed on enemies now creates a new visual hit effect, this slash effect's color depends on the color of the weapon\n\t- Bullet hit effects, each bullet hit landed on enemies now creates a new visual hit effect, this hit effect's color depends on the color of the bullet\n\nThrowing improvements\n\t- Throwable items now are thrown correctly and keep the inertia from the hands and player.\n\t- Increased the throw force of throwable items.\n\t- Increased the precision when throwing items.\n\t- Lowered the bounce factor of the throwable bomb\n\nSkins table (work in progress, skins doesnt work in

rotate the NPC\n\t\t\t· Displacement direction, Looks at the direction of the displacement\n\t\t\t· Only Y axis, looks at the direction of the displacement but only in the vertical axis\n\t\t· Easing option: enable or disable the easing of the movement in the spline for NPCs\n\t- Animation Module (New)\n\t\t· For playing NPC animations (only if they have (Lobb-e doesnt have animations yet))\n\t- Look At Module (New)\n\t\t· Created for exclusive look at interactions with the following options:\n\t\t\t· View target: you can set a point in the world, a fixed direction or the player head for making those npcs look at you\n\t\t\t· Rotation modes:\n\t\t\t\t· Continuous: makes the character move their head to look at the target, they can move the body too if they need until stopped\n\t\t\t\t· Single: pose the whole character for be looking straight to that target in a single shot, not continuous, it rotates the whole npc Holder\n\t- Module objects for npcs have been

indicatior for easier tracking of working modules\n\nSkate and Skate Goal items now are available for public use, these items will be improved in the future, in the meanwhile you can use them now

smoother visually, they will also receive a visual improvement soon\n\nRemoved dark coins from the game as they caused confusion and added unnecessary complexity to the currency system.\nThe dark coins were originally added to signify coins without value, but we realized it's easier to understand the system without them.\n\nImproved the suction power for floating loot (coins, hearts) making far loot to come faster to you when raising your hand\n\nNow when in the tutorial you can just leave it by returning to the lobby (Tutorial will still loading each time you start the game, so we recommend completing it so it doesnt appears anymore)\n\nModified the grab origin of the hands, previously you had to grab with the fingers almost, now the grabbing point is closer to the palms\n\nAdded collisions to the floor of that multiplayer spawn place in the lobby\n\n---------- Other Visual changes ----------\n\n\t- modified the basic model of the base skin of the hand now with

period\n\t- Resolved issues with Greenlink causing links to disappear when removing a single node after reloading a level\n\t- Fixed cases where Greenlink nodes were arranged incorrectly after

resistances in enemies, which were not being utilized at all\n\t- Fixed knockback forces that were being applied multiple times per hit, causing enemies to be propelled too far\n\t- Balanced knockback forces for hands' punches and slaps, as well as other knockback forces in the game\n\t- Resolved a memory leak associated with Greenlink, improving game performance in Greenlink levels and reducing lag spikes\n\t- Fixed an error that prioritized loading user-created levels over built-in levels by name\n\t- Corrected a visual bug that delayed the player replay ghost, resulting in inaccurate time measurements\n\t- Fixed issues with \"Retry\" and \"Restart Level\" buttons not appearing in built-in levels\n\t- Corrected hand rotations in the login scene\n\t- Resolved an issue that caused

                "change_log": "PATCH NOTES FOR 0.8.17\nThe new update also affects the demo these are the news!\n\nHello everyone!\nI know, I know, it has been SOOO LONG without an update\nLet me explain...\n\n\nCurrent developer state\n\nOriginally I didn't plan to update the game until 0.9.0 is ready (we still working on it), but I don't have as much time as I need\nBecause I work full time on another game for another enterprise in order to not starve, I do my best every day when I finish my job and get at home, squeezing until the last drop of time and energy.\n\nFor that reason, I post more content on weekends as I have more time for Hyperstacks!\n\n\nBut finally an update!!\n\nYes, it is NOT the 0.9.0 yet BUT its getting closer\nSo I just decided I had to do a little update because the game was getting really outdated, and this way would make it better for advance to the next phase\n\nSo let's start telling whats new in this new patch 0.8.17\n\n\nWHAT'S NEW:\n\n\n9 Languages! \nmore info below\n\n\nNow arrows appears when you select a level indicating you have to go back to the teleporter to enter in a level\n\n\nChanged how the hp regen works\nNow coins don't heal anymore, just the Hearts\nHearts have a different spawn rate and probability than coins\nHearts only will spawn if you need more healing than current heals on the map\n(for example, if you have 9 of 10 hearts, there will not be more than one floating pickable heart)\nthis will make combat a little bit more challenging, it has been also designed in this way to avoid the lets-accumulate-a-lot-of-floating-coins-so-when-I'm-low-on-hp-i-can-heal-easily exploit\n\n\nLava Block!\nThis is a new block made to get more OUCH in the game, you can put some together and they will be seamless\nYou can almost swim if you move your hands on it, but its really hard and you will get much PAIN\n\n\nParty Blower!\nGive your levels more party feeling with this new thing that makes funny party noises\nAs a creator, use it to reward the player when they do things good\nBut if you are the player, you just should feel rewarded, yeah... just obey!\n\n\nNPCs in Levels\nWell, there is just one NPC... but the system is prepared for the next coming new NPCs!\nThe system may seem a little tricky to use, but I promise it really easy and you can do many things with this.\nThe new tutorial level is made entirely using the level editor, with this feature!\nA video tutorial coming soon on our Youtube Channel.\nCurrently, the phrases the NPC can say, are limited to the ones created for the game, such as salutations and so!\nBut In the future updates, you will have a customizable NPC for you, which you can use to create custom dialogs\n\n\nWater surface (WIP)\nIt's like the Lava block but it doesn't hurt you,\ntechnically you should be able to swim on it, but due to lack of time, the water is not ready yet,\nBut hey! you can use it for decorating the levels for now!\nI will make patches more usually after this update so it may be fixed fast\n\n\nController Messages\nThis new item has been designed to teach the player how to use things in the game\nSo you can put a controller message for grabbing,\nand when this is activated, the player will receive a notification in their controller telling him how to use something,\nthis is mainly done for tutorial levels\n\n\nPlayer setup item\nThis item was only for developers, but I decided to publish it also,\nThis is an item that will let you change player properties, as if the player is immortal, or if it can move at all\nCurrently, you can only change the \"Can move\" option\nBut more options will come.\nUse it properly, you could make a player not be able to move,\nbe sure to notify the player with a message or something if you stop their movement so they don't feel it weird\n\n\nLook At Activators\nA useful item that activates a point to look at when receiving energy, it also activates other connected systems when looked at.\nYou can use it to tell the player something like \"HEY LOOK AT THIS!!\" but without texts\nBecause nobody really likes reading, why are you even reading this!?\n\n\nNew Tutorial Level\nGo with Lobb-E (The robot cat) inside a level\nwhile he teaches you how to do some of the hardest things in the game.... like... walking!\n\n\nNew Training Levels in the Campaign Section\nNow the campaign section has the 5... I mean 4 levels you can play to test different modalities of levels\nThis section has also the tutorial button if you want to test it again because you love the cat so much\nThese levels are present in the Demo version, but this space is designed for the coming Campaign levels of the update 0.9.0\n\n\nNPCs In Buildings\nYeah right... the buildings are also something new (at least inside)\nNow you can see the interior of each building, remember those stills in development\nSo we just gave just permission to look inside, you're welcome!\nAhh also the NPCs of each building are inside, so you can see them, they do nothing but some animations,\nLet them relax while they can as update 0.9.0 gets closer\n\n\nCoin system rework\n\nCoin system is now totally different\nFrom now coins will be accumulated in your account forever\nThis has been made this way to prepare the game for the coming Skin content and coin usage\n\n\nNow sometimes dark coins will appear\nDark coins have no value, the more colored coins you collect in little time the more probabilities are for dark coins to spawn\nDark coins spawn probability decreases at a rate of 100% hour\nthis avoids farming coins in levels and filling the level selector with levels\n\n\nOnly Verified levels can give coins now\nAlso to avoid coin farming levels spam\nIf you want your level to be verified it just has to be fun, with quality enough and should stay at 90fps in Quest2 (you can check the FPS graph in the Experimental settings)\nIf you feel your level should be verified, let us know in our Discord\nThere are plans for level creators to also get coins when people play their levels, stay tunned\n\n\nYou can check how many coins you have at the Museum/Bank (that purple building)\nWhere you will see MR.Snobble NPC, and also in front of him is a special floating card, that card represents your current money in the game\nGO GO PLAY AND GET COINS FOR THE FUTURE CONTENT!\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS & CHANGES\n\nBetter Level Lights Management\nSome good changes have been made to the lights\nnow you can activate and deactivate the lights\nAs there is a limit of 8 lights per level, some big levels with more than 8 lights get them flashing randomly, as the game tries to only render 8 lights, some lights just turn off automatically breaking the level visuals.\nSo now you can manually turn On/Off lights on your levels using Green links, to reduce the number of active lights when these are not needed\n\n\nLight balls are now hidden by default for the player\nyou can change its visibility using the visibility modifier of the Green Link mode in the level editor\n\n\nAdded slight hand jitter filtering for level editor menus\nnow level editor menus will see lees jittery, due they move more smoothly\nGo put that block in that pixel you ever wanted it to be\n\n\nAdded a cooldown to the green target activators\nto avoid double activations which results in not activating the object when switch mode is enabled\n\n\nThe Level Goal Teleporter for getting in and out of levels, or however that thing is called, Now has a new fancier effect than before\nAhh right, this is because the goal is not an ugly ball anymore, now its a whole level Exit teleport, I don't know how to call those, in order to not make it easily confoundable with the coming teleporters for inside levels\n\n\nZip lines are now thinner and yellow\nThis helps to fit the color meanings of the game\n\n\nHand menu is easier to spawn now\nusually, for opening the menu you needed to press A or X and then touch a \"Menu\" tab in the other hand, this has very counterintuitive and not beginner friendly\nSo it's been changed how it works now.\nCurrently for opening the menu you just need to hold A or X, it will just appear\n\n\nOther small rendering improvements...\n\n\nFIXES\n\nActivatable objects were not saving their state correctly\nYou have may experienced, that manually enabled jump pads don't remain active when reloading the level,\nwell, that was happening with every activatable object that can be manually activated, so this I Fixed now!\n\n\nZip lines now store their positions correctly even if you don't modify the tips\nSometimes when you reload the level you may have seen that the zip/grind lines were not where you left them\nThis is fixed now!\n\n\nLight bridges fixed, now they stop where they should\nSometimes they were trespassing walls and so, not anymore now!\n\n\nPink Lasers are now Blocked by light bridges\nI think I don't need to explain anything here!\n\n\nLasers don't receive light anymore\nThere was a problem with lasers, that if you put a light next to a laser, it enlights the lasser\nit had no sense and its fixed now\n\n\nFixed Laser texture transparencies\nLasers' transparent textures were so big, and you could see lines on the edges when getting close...\nIt's hard to explain, never mind it's fixed, why bother?\n\n\nZipline grind particle is now correctly synced\nlately, the grind particle was getting behind you the faster you go on the zipline, now that particle is ok\n\n\nOther several small and big fixes\nLet's be honest, I don't have so much time for writing this,\nand I also fixed so many things that I don't remember what those are, so I will just say \"Other several\nfixes\"\n\n\n\nCongratulations if you got here!\nNow I will say thanks for reading and be good while we still working on this!\n\nAs this is a new patch with new content, there will be new bugs, so I'm PRETTY sure you will find some bugs be sure to report them in our Discord!\nWe are also really open for feedback in there, so don't be shy, just join, chill and give us your feedback... obey!"
