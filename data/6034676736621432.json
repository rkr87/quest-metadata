        "description": "A playground classic, reinvented.\nPlay Tetherball in mindblowing worlds!\n\nEXPLORE energetic or relaxing worlds that flourish as you play\nCONNECT with friends and family with voice chat\nCHALLENGE yourself in solo rally or competitive 2-player*\n\nWe are Kinetic Art Labs, a Mixed Reality game studio creating social and fun experiences for all ages. Our launch title TetherballVR gives people a throwback to the classic game, hitting a tethered ball around a pole with hands or bats, whilst exploring fantastic worlds - built in collab with artists: S. Fan, Colormotor, Metaxu Studio, A. Zelinskie; and musicians, B. Dixon and DJ J. Boy.\n\nSingle Player Rally: Hit the ball in solo mode and dynamically build up the world around you as you maximise your rally count against the clock! Play 3, 5 or 10 minutes games and hit combos to unlock hidden animations.\n\nTwo Player Mode*: Express your competitive edge as you face off (and chat) with an opponent to wrap the ball around the pole with 6, 9 or 12 rotations targets.\n\n* This is our Open Beta release - depending on internet connection and our server you may currently experience some lag in online 2-player version - thank you for your patience, we are working on this!\n\nCombos are defined by the number of shots in a row without misses. Each combo triggers a rewarding animation that will last until the player misses. Three hits Right or Left hand, or alternate hand 6 shots.\n\nImmerse yourself in TetherballVR and find your flow.\n",
