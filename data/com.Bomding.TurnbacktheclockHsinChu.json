The story will revolve around a historian and an agent of the Time and Space Security Agency. Players can alternately play the roles to be played according to the progress of the plot, and experience the same script from different perspectives as a starting point, through different perspectives. Encounter, correct, and repair historical events, experience conflict, cooperation, choice, and other plots, and finally work together to catch the mastermind and explore his motives.\n\nThe game is not limited to static observation and puzzle solving, but also has dynamic action elements for players to complete when encountering emergencies. The puzzle-solving theme is easy to use, but also in line with the historical era, fully demonstrating the humanistic history of Hsinchu, creating a very high sense of immersion in the era, and sometimes the player's choice will also affect the direction of the plot. In addition, the option of 360 view appreciation is also provided, and five scenic spots with on-site 4K high-resolution stereo shooting with VR 180/360 are waiting for players to have a glimpse of the actual appearance of Hsinchu City.\n",
