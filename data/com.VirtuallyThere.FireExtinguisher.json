        "description": "Fires can spread quickly, doubling in size every minute.  This is why seconds count in emergencies. Training and preparation are vital for a quick response time... so why not improve your fire suppression skills from the safety and comfort of your home or office?  \n\nSuitable for use in corporate training, public education, firefighting and safety expos, and more.\n\nPractice using the P.A.S.S. method – Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep\n\n✔ 8 Training scenarios\n✔ Voice tips and help videos\n✔ Unlimited training opportunities\n\nPassThru Instructions:\n\nFires will spawn on couches and desks in your room and spread up your walls.  It is up to you to extinguish the fire before it grows out of control.\n\n•\tFirst, configure your Room Setup. (Currently found in the Quest Menu – Settings – Experimental – Room Setup). Follow the instructions to setup your room and include Walls, Couches and Desks.   If you see a canister fire during PassThru mode, it means your 'Room Setup' is not completed. \n\n•\tTo have fire in one specific area (i.e. you are staging a scenario) setup your room to include walls and then just one single couch in the designated location for your fire.\n\n•\tYou can reposition the Extinguisher Stand by re-centering your headset (long-press Oculus button).\n\nNote: This is only a simulated training tool and should not be used in conjunction with any form of live-fire training.  \n\nVirtually There Training... We build Firefighter Training Sims, Fire Safety Apps, and Custom VR Solutions!  \n",
