        "description": "Falls from height are a significant cause of injury at worksites worldwide, many of which can be avoided with proper training, defined processes, and safety equipment. \n\nThe immersive Fall Awareness and Protection simulation begins with an overview of height-related hazards, safety equipment, the five hierarchies of fall protection and their associated levels of risk. Next, participants are asked to match risks and their descriptions for each fall protection hierarchy. Finally, the simulation places participants in a factory setting, moving freely throughout the environment. It tasks them with identifying potential fall hazards, from unmarked holes in the ground and broken equipment to observing workers on ladders, scaffolds, and machinery at height without arrests or restraints.  \n\nGamified elements include identifying ten potential issues in five minutes or less. The simulation provides instant feedback with either “correct” or “try again” responses to encourage participants to reconsider their choices and allows them to revisit any part of the simulation as often as needed. \n\nEmbedded learning outcomes based on Bloom’s revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying. \n\nBenefits include: \n•Realistic 3D tools, equipment and environments \n•Interactive activities \n•Transferrable skills ",
