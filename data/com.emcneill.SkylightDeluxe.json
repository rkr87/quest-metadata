        "description": "Skylight is a VR turn-based tactics game of colossal space battles.\nâ€‹\nOn the bridge of your flagship, a holographic projector shows your fleet floating in space, facing the enemy and awaiting your orders.  Command nimble squadrons of fighters, specialized frigates, and giant capital ships as you orchestrate your forces toward victory.\n\nThe new Deluxe Edition includes new missions and ships, for a total of 15 unique ship types!\n\nPlay through 36 Campaign missions, create your own in Skirmish mode, or play a Multiplayer match against your friends or a stranger. The multiplayer is turn-based, so you don't need to be online at the same time as your opponent. You can input your fleet's orders on your own time and come back to continue playing the match later!\n\n\"Skylight has been perfectly formulated with engaging gameplay, quirky visuals and hours of entertainment. (5/5)\" - VRFocus\n\nSkylight is the 3rd VR game from E McNeill, creator of the award-winning Gear VR games Darknet and Tactera.",
