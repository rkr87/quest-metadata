        "description": "Welcome to Street Sense, an interactive game that teaches some of the skills you need to be a safer driver in real life.\n\nIn this game, you'll get to drive around on virtual roads and learn important things like how to spot dangerous situations on the road, how to turn safely, and how to share the road with others.\n\nStreet Sense is for new drivers who are just starting out and for experienced drivers who want to get better at driving. You'll experience different driving situations and learn how to deal with them, just like you would in real life.\n\nAs you drive around, you'll need to keep an eye out for potential dangers and use special tools in the game to help you if you get stuck. These tools are called \"power-ups\" and they can help you out when you need it the most.\n\nWhen you're feeling confident, you can take a test to see how much you've learned in the Street Sense Road Test.\n\nSo, are you ready to become a great driver? Let's play Street Sense and learn how to drive safely!",
