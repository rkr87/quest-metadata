        "description": "This app's a VR museum where you can explore 65 works as they have never seen before. \nThe player has locomotion to move through several rooms marked by key dates in her history. \nYou can know about her life with a virtual character who, from some monitors, explains her biography in an entertaining and didactic way. \nMaria Blanchard (1881-1932). She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'Ã©cole de Paris,  \n\nThis VR Museum is intended to pay tribute to the great artist and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public.",
