        "description": "Into The Now, is a heart-stopping, immersive dive into our Oceans. Michael Muller takes you on nine, inspiring, one-of-a-kind experiences. \n\nFrom the Galapagos Islands to the Arctic Circle, you will dive with pods of Killer Whales, Pregnant Whale Sharks, Manatees, schools of Hammerheads, 500+ Dolphins, swimming out of the cage with Great White Sharks and more. Each film not only highlights the many issues our Oceans are facing, but also aims to change perceptions about the many creatures that inhabit our Oceans. When you find yourself face to face with a Crocodile or swimming amongst half a dozen Great White sharks, you will see these animals in their true light and not the monsters you may have been taught they were. \n\nThis is also a personal story about conquering fear. Muller confronts some of his deepest fears and see how these experiences changed his life. This is an extraordinary exploration into the Sea, and the closest you will ever get to these creatures without getting wet.",
