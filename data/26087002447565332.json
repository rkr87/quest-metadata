        "description": "Rescue The HOLES is an indie mixed reality puzzle game where you have to help rescue and navigate cute ring-like characters, known as \"HOLES\", through a series of pipes, traps and other dangers without touching them! \n\nThis game was inspired by the childhood science wireloop game, where you have to rely on hand stability. \n\nThere are various difficulty modes which you can set:\n\nEasy - Each HOLE recovers its HP, after taking damage.\nNormal - HOLES do not recover, with a finite HP.\nHard - HOLES only take 1 hit.\n\nThere are currently 50+ levels of various difficulty levels, with more to come in the future!\n\n1) Beginner (Green)\n2) Intermediate (Yellow)\n3) Hard (Red)\n4) Insane (Purple)\n\nHelp the HOLES navigate through these obstacles and challenges:\n\n1) Pipes - Avoid coming into contact with the pipes, these deal frictional damage to the HOLES.\n2) Traps - Avoid the traps that deal maximum damage!\n3) Junction switches - Find and activate the switches to cross-junctions and obstacles to reach the final destination.\n4) Fattening cheese - Grow bigger to overcome bigger pipes\n5) Chains - Navigate 2 holes that are chained together\n\nRescueTheHoles may not be suitable for players who suffer from severe nerve or psychomotor issues as it requires a small degree of hand stability. However, it is designed to cater to a wide range of audience with the various difficulty modes.\n\nDo give HOLES a chance! You won't regret it!\n\nThank you for your support!",
