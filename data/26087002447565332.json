        "description": "Hey there!\n\nRescue The HOLES is an indie mixed reality puzzle game where you have to help rescue and navigate cute loopy characters, known as \"HOLES\", through a series of pipes, traps and other dangers without touching them! \n\nThis game was originally designed and created by an indie engineer who grew up with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with the social mission of building games to help improve focus, resilience and problem solving in ADD folks, and somehow evolved into something cuter?\n\nYou can set the general game difficulty mode if you find the level too difficult or easy, under the settings panel.\n\nEasy - Each HOLE recovers its HP, after taking damage.\nNormal - HOLES do not recover, with a finite HP.\nHard - HOLES only take 1 hit.\n\nThere are currently 30 levels of various difficulty levels, with the goal of reaching 150 levels by end of this year! Each level has also a difficulty category:\n\n1) Beginner (Green)\n2) Intermediate (Yellow)\n3) Hard (Red)\n4) Insane (Purple)\n\nHelp the HOLES navigate through these obstacles and challenges:\n\n1) Pipes - Avoid coming into contact with the pipes, these deal frictional damage to the HOLES.\n2) Traps - Avoid the traps that deal maximum damage!\n3) Junction switches - Find and activate the switches to cross-junctions and obstacles to reach the final destination.\n4) Fattening cheese - Grow bigger to overcome bigger pipes\n5) Timer\n\nDo give HOLES a chance! Thank you for supporting my project!",
