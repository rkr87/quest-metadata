Message stays up until a controller is attached, then the app continues\n\nInput.3: Made the back button bring up the platform quit dialog when on the main menu.  While playing a movie, it still brings up the jump menu\n\nInput.6: Fixed an issue where the ray casting wouldn't work for left-handed controllers.  Also fixed the tooltips on the left-handed controller.  Tested this by switching hands while the app was running and it seems to work"
