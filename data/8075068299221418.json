        "description": "# About\n\nSpatialFlashcards is the VR flashcard app that gives you control over your cards. With the ability to import card sets directly as text files, you never have to worry about internet connection, subscriptions, or micro transactions. It gives you all of the spatial memory benefits of physical flashcards, without any of the tedious organization.\n\n# Gamemodes\n\nSpatialFlashcards comes with 2 game modes, each designed to help you build memory in different ways. \n\n- The first game mode is a grid of 4 terms and their definitions, randomly ordered. You can drag and drop the terms to their definitions, and once you clear the grid the next 4 cards are loaded in until the game is complete. This mode is best for building initial, short term memory. \n\n- The second game mode is the more conventional way of using flashcards, where each card is loaded one at a time onto a virtual flashcard. Once you've completed all of the cards in a set, you can have the option to go through just the cards that were incorrect, for a more focused review. This mode is best for testing yourself and your long term memory.\n\n# Environments and Soundtrack\n\nSpatialFlashcards ships with five relaxing soundtracks and six 360 degree environments (not including passthrough). However, all music and UI sounds can be disabled in settings.\n\n# Support and Feedback\n\nThis app comes with video guides and a FAQ webpage on how to use it, along with bug reports and developer support to ensure it works for you.",
