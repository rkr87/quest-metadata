        "description": "What advice would you give a friend in your situation? The Alterscope lets you have a new kind of conversation where you are transported into the viewpoint of someone else. As someone else, you can listen to and offer advice to yourself with the same empathy and understanding you might give a friend.\n\nYou can also observe the conversation as a third person, allowing you to gain insight from an outside point of view.\n\nYou wonâ€™t need to worry if your conversation partner has time or can be trusted; the dialogue is private and completely in your control.\n\nThe Alterscope is a unique tool to understand yourself, expand your imagination, and push the limits of your perspective.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This program is for entertainment purposes only. It is not intended to treat any mental illness or other medical condition.",
