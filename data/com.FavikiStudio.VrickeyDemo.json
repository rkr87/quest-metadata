        "description": "DEMO CONTAINS 15 FREE LEVELS\n\nVrickey is a VR vertical shooter with a twist—you use your body to guide the spaceship through the maze while clearing the path with twin guns.\n\nMake sure you keep away from the falling deadly balls, survive the trippy magic potions and dodge the cannonballs, relentlessly aiming for your head. The journey won't be easy, this challenging arcade will put your focus to the ultimate test!\n\nThe game can be as large as you wish—it adapts to any room size. It works best with a rectangular play space that allows more movement in less space, as it uses one dimension for moving. A large Guardian can turn the game into a fun fitness experience!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Campaign: 5 stages x 10 levels = 50 levels in total (the first 15 levels in the demo)\n- Arcade: Infinite survival in normal, hard and turbo modes\n- 4 different weapons\n- Using movement and body gestures to control the ship (see below)\n- The game scales to fit the play space; increase the boundary size for a larger and more difficult game\n- 3 different achievements per level\n- An optional, distraction free “Zen” environment\n\nGESTURES\n\n- Raise your hands to speed up\n- Crouch to slow down\n- Lean back for backward flip\n- Jump to activate a special weapon",
