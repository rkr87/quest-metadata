Now always on. We simply just have to push up/down on the controller stick.\n  + In app help screen updated to reflect new button mappings.\n\nBug Fixes\n==========\n- Fix anonymous SMB logins not working on some linux boxes\n- Try to make app more robust/aware of smb connection drops\n- Fix small bug where name filtering was not working for folders in dlna"

However, the legacy eye buffer method of rendering 180/360 views can be re-enabled again via the \"Use legacy eye buffer... \" option in the Player Settings menu, which will then also re-enable the zooming and height adjustment feature again when in 180/360 view mode.\n\nNote 2: Those using their own custom build of the libvlc library should still be able to continue using their current custom build without any side effects. However, it is highly recommended to update your personal libvlc build to be built from the latest libvlc code base linked from the Pigasus FAQ so as to take advantage of any updates and/or bug fixes made to the library over the last year and if nothing else, to ensure better sync to what Pigasus expects from the library."
