        "description": "Nock is bow and arrow soccer.\n\nSkate and fly around a pitch while using a bow and arrow to blast the ball into the other team‚Äôs goal. Compete in multiplayer ranked matches, or play casual custom games with your friends! \n\nLike a real sport, Nock is easy to learn but difficult to master. Block arrows let you create obstacles and you can even use your body to make a goal or save. A fast-moving ball can knock you out. Skill-based matchmaking keeps every game extremely close and competitive. Casual modes let you challenge yourself against bots or play with friends in custom matches.\n\nNock includes voice chat with individual muting options so you can communicate with teammates easily.",
