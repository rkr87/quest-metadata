        "description": "TrainerVR is a unique physics-based VR train construction game.\nIn TrainerVR you can create from simple tracks to an elaborate rail network, just like the wooden piece game, but to the infinity and beyond, and drive the trains inside your creations!\n\nHave you ever feel the despair of running out of tracks just when the fun was sparkling?\nHave you ever dreamed about a huge train network connecting towns, going  up and down, intersecting and looping?\nIf you liked building with your own bare hands, you’ll feel the same in our limitless VR world and see your dreams come true.\n\nBut this is not only about the destination; it's also about the journey. Enjoy building your structures, growing more complex, while fighting against Newton’s laws.\n\nOnce the job is done you can place as many trains as you want and ensure everyone’s safety avoiding crashes acting like a profesional train traffic controller.\n\nOnce you go track you can't go back. Come aboard!",
