Here's what you can expect: \n1. New Level - Quena's Requiem: This enthralling new level can be accessed right from the Tuvanian Church and is also a major part of your main quest. I can't wait for you to explore it! 2. Handtracking Upgrade: Expect a significant boost in the stability and usability of hand-tracking. It's smoother and more intuitive than ever! \n3. More Gameplay: The adventure has been stretched, promising an average playtime of 8+ hours. For the completionists, prepare for a 15+ hour deep-dive into Eolia's world! \n4. Simplified Chinese Subtitles: Ni Hao! We've added subtitles in Simplified Chinese. More language options are just around the corner. \n5. Quest Pro Update & Fidelity Increase: We've fine-tuned the Quest Pro for an even more immersive experience. \n6. Revamped Tutorial Level: Access an upgraded tutorial level via the Main Menu. Perfect for new players or anyone needing a quick refresher. \n7. Enhanced Challenges: We've ramped up the Lhargo Run and added a twist to the Nahgrus Mohre tornado storm for an extra dose of adrenaline. \n8. Memori Modus Puzzle Upgrade: We've tweaked this puzzle to make it accessible and enjoyable for even more users. \n9. Improved Tools: The functionality of your Flute (super-powers), Journal (options), and Satchel (inventory bag) has been greatly improved for a better gaming experience. \n10. Audio-Visual Upgrades: Expect a visual treat and enhanced audio experience across all maps. \n11. Rare Collectables: We've sprinkled rare collectibles across Eolia, with an increased chance to find them all. This one's dedicated to our most devoted fans! \n12. Katarian Gloves Usability: Both single and double-handed Katarian gloves have been revamped for better far-field grab ability. And last, but definitely not least... \n13. Community Feedback Improvements: A massive thanks to our wonderful Discord community for all the valuable feedback! We've made several improvements based on your suggestions. \n\nThe ROTU team appreciates each and every one of you for helping us refine the world of Eolia. We're so excited for you to experience all these changes! Thanks for adventuring with us. Happy Gaming! Jason Parks CEO, ROTU.com"
