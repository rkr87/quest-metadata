When their dog, Rishu, goes missing, they turn to you for help.\n\nGuide your kid to explore extraordinary worlds, and work together to discover hidden secrets. Harness the power of imagination to lift trees, move boulders, power incredible machines, and create new paths where there are none to follow.\n\nFind Rishu, and bring him home!\n\nWORK TOGETHER\nGuide the kid using your cursor, and use your imaginary friend powers to manipulate the world around you with motion controls.\n\nEXPLORE & DISCOVER\nGlide through colorful, toybox-like environments with puzzle-platforming action across more than a dozen handcrafted levels.\n\nCOLLECT TREASURES\nThe world is filled with toys left behind by kids who came before you. Uncover them, add them to your collection, and play with them in your treehouse.\n\nFrom the developers of Floor Plan!",
