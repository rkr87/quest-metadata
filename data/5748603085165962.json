So enlist now, pick your mission, and let the bullet-time flashbangs roll on the floor!\n\nKey Features\n\n* Single player campaign story with handcrafted levels and many beautiful environments.\n* Co-op multiplayer up to 4 players.\n* Zombie survival mode â€“ there is only one outcome but they say the fun is in the journey.\n* Guns, grenades, drones, shields and more.\n* Unleash the bullet-time flashbangs!\n* Suit up with bHaptics support!\n\nJoin the ranks of Operation Serpens Discord unit -> discord.gg/vRjwPdjpGB",
