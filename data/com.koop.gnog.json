        "description": "\"I was in love with GNOG the second I saw it\"-Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"Weird and wonderful...\" -Polygon\n\"This is such a joyful game, I'm not sure it's possible to leave it without feeling uplifted.\" -Destructoid\n\"It's a kooky idea brought about with lots of style and verve...\" -Eurogamer\n\nGNOG is a 3D puzzle game set in a tactile world of toys and secrets. Point, click, grab, poke, spin, pull, and play with uniquely charming monster heads as you explore the hidden worlds inside them.\n\nInspired by real-world toy designs, every GNOG head is a miniature world to discover. Grab a bookcase and spin it to reveal a hidden pile of coins, slide levers to navigate a damaged ship through outer space, crank a wheel to cook a stew on the stove â€“ each playful interaction generates lively feedback and surprising consequences. Set to a relaxing and dynamic soundtrack that evolves with each level, the surreal worlds and joyful puzzles of GNOG will have you turning heads.",
