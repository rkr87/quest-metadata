        "description": "VAFES Online is a virtual reality game that allows users to test and measure their motor skills through a series of fun and engaging minigames. The game is designed to be both challenging and entertaining, providing players with a range of activities that require precise movements, quick reflexes, and hand-eye coordination.\n\nUpon entering the game, users are greeted with a futuristic-looking menu that displays a variety of different minigames to choose from. Each game is designed to test a specific aspect of motor skill, such as reaction time, precision, and spatial precision.\n\nAs users progress through each minigame, their scores and performance are tracked and recorded, allowing them to see how their motor skills are rated.\n\nOverall, \"VAFES Online\" is a fun and engaging virtual reality game that provides users with a unique way to test and improve their motor skills. Whether you're looking to challenge yourself or just have some fun, this game is sure to keep you entertained.\n\nVAFES Online is part of a research project of Ruhr-University Bochum, where we develop a standardized test for diagnosing motor function disorders in Virtual Reality (VR). We use modern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as deep learning, in the context of diagnosis and therapy of neurological diseases with hand and arm dysfunctions. Studies like this are necessary to obtain reliable new research results. However, an indispensable prerequisite for carrying out a study is that you give your consent",
