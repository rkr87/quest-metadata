Users can also conveniently share media files from computers within the same local area network to their VR devices. Support MVC 3D decoding and playback, such as MVC 3D in the following file formats: Blu-ray 3D ISO, mkv, m2ts, ts, mts, etc.\n\nA notable feature of Super Screen is its multi-platform support, including PC operating systems like Windows and Mac, allowing users to stream video content from their PCs to the big screen in their VR device. This cross-platform capability makes Super Screen suitable not just for entertainment purposes, like watching movies, but also for educational and business environments, such as virtual classrooms and meeting rooms.
