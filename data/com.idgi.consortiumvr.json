Lightmaps now used exclusively, but with dynamic shadows (PC only - possibly Quest 3 in future)\n\n-Final choreography polish done for:  Pawn 4 near the end, Pawns in barracks, important hangar bay three-character ensemble convo, Pawn 64 encounter, Pawn 64 first convo in beginning,\n\n-Many brand new Information Console articles can now be found, and many more articles polished and improved for accuracy.\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Fixed characters in chairs not rotating to face the player in a lot of cases\n-Fixed crash that happaned on plane destruction\n-General fixes and improvements for traitor fight\n-Fixed being able to knock down the traitor with the shotgun\n-If traitor was somehow incapped during the unknown traitor fight when the game is loaded, it is now corrected.\n-Fixed bug where the bishops cabin virus state wasn't reverted after all possible paths out of the P64 encounter. The virus state would keep running even after the virus was fixed.\n-Fixed bad B bug that could occur if XXXX died juuust before the player's healing nanites completed, erroneously causing both states to be true at the same time (XXXX could die but *also* get up and walk to a chair ;-P)\n-Fixed XXXX not thanking the Bishop for being saved due to old rotten Hammer script based around button pressing.\n-Fixed VT turning back on no matter what after player chooses traitor, causing ISSUES - fixed so that now the VT turning on will now only turn on if the player's bed (Dream 2) is turning back on as well. \n-Added NPC body pose value interpolation \n-NPCs which are in convo limbo with the player now stay in their choreo animation state so there should be no more “snaps” when NPCs are in-between sequences.\n-Fixed issue with time slowing down while in menus during the intro before Kiril\n-Fixed the menu button not working when in left handed mode\n-Fixed all instances of “NPC arms going through furniture” in the first half of the game.

This fixes a ton of erroneous and missing changes.\n-Fixed instance of Pawn 32 in the hangar bay erroneously teleporting across the room.\n-Changed 'SkipSerialization' to 'Transient' UPROPERTY param so the property is zero'd. I get a feeling this was causing memory bleed between saves for the chip minigame.\n-Fixed the tutorial window sometimes showing on top of the bishop HUD in VR because of timings\n-Fixed getting into quantum limbo and improved a couple more things there\n-VR: Fixed valve index controllers not bound to the new utility functions properly. They use the A buttons now as the B buttons are reserved for the menu button in that case.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n-Player can no longer use the flashlight with no armor equipped. \n-Tweaked runtime of a critical path cmc convo to address super long pause\n-Further reduced pause until XXXX stops and turns around when confronted - is now 1- 3 seconds.\n-Upped background opacity on the info console from .4 to .8\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-VR: lliteral press indication on the arm HUD heal and repair now. The buttons appear to press in as you hold your finger there and release when letting go.\n-Clean up for heal and repair indication. Now it tells you if you can't repair/heal because of low utility.\n-Intro dream sound/music polish\n-Localization: German, Spanish and Russian completed.\n-Zenlil Defense Minigame: \n-FX Zenlil damage particles polished\n-Added Zenlil health and energy to the arm HUD \n-Virtual Trainer:\n\t-New iDGi VT user scenario “Death Gauntlet” added to pool.\n-Other than some additional polish and tweaks, the VT is now content complete for v1.0.\n-Final-ish level design and FX pass made to VT Combat 1. Ceilings, multi-sized walls, added two heavy shielded AIs that stay in one spot (the retreat zone for AIs) and will only stir if they detect the player. \n-VT Combat 2 - vastly simplified level. Players must shut down all spawners to open ending. Finalized loadouts, spawn counts/patrols, level completion logic, animated ending squar., \n-The VT now unlocks after the briefing.\n-Fixed XXXX disintegration sequence having animation spazzes due to unnecessary anims in level sequences. Also polished up final XXXX scene choreo before XXXX dies to reveal more emotion.\n-Updated HUD visuals for Health and Armor. \n-Added the repairing wrench over the Armor HUD indicator when repairing (animated)\n-Updated fonts\n-Updated/finished front-end iDGi logo animation sheet\n-A.I tuning polish pass: AI health/stamina related Confidence values tuned to change more often based on combat conditions, more fleeing behaviour if everyone's stamina is super low they may all \"regroup\" before re-engaging. Sped up recovery times from combatants downed by CEAR sonic blasts considerably for much better pacing.\n-NEW ENDING (developing…)\n-Objectives for post briefing finalized.\n-Final “EPILOGUE” Chapter save now happens after first King convo\n-iDGi-1 stream degradation now starts to kick in after final convo of stream.\n-Original soundscape in ending Quantum Limbo restored\n-New ending Quantum Limbo video window\n-Setup the teleportation sequence logic from the freefall into the new dream sequence approach. \n- All ending teleports fixed up and working.\n-Music Finalizing ( developing… ) \n-removed unnecessary big orchestral hit with player death\n-brand new music for briefing\""

The players collision radius and center are properly calculated for both VR and 2D now.\n-Fixed NPCs being able to see the VR player almost always because of a bloated render bounds on the arms skeleton. (The above fix solves this)\n-Fixed two package build errors in rooms and scripted sequences related to editor only components\n-now controlling when to cache shaders on mobile platforms so the consortium loading dial comes up sooner\n-spaced out some IO operations at boot so they don't slow eachother down all running at once (speech to life, shader cache, save and config)\n\nVirtual Trainer Editor:\n-Fix for toolbar not showing all elements in VR\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Experimental German translation of entire narrative.

These were accidentally added via a recent patch from choreo polishing work and sadly caused the game to just stop in many cases. If your game was affected by this, you may have to turn back time to just after the Zenlil Missile Defense sequence to avoid issues. We will work hard to make sure something like this never happens again and apologize for the inconvenience it may have caused.\n\nC3800 Defense Minigame:  \n-Fixed laser beams not appearing to hold their fire onto fighters and solidified and fixed some other bugs in the code around them. Lasers will now never get “stuck on”.\n\n- Fixed cabin door models not aligned to the track causing noticable gaps\n- Fixed battery crawl lights not assigned to the room\n- Fixed galley light not flickering with the light itself\n- All console chairs now have a basic collision so the player cannot walk through them anymore\n- Did a complete pass of the collision turning off \"can step up on\" in cases where the player in 2D mode could step up onto things like chairs for example which felt odd\n- Fixed being able to stand on K15s platform, added player collision in replacement.\n- Added collision for more cases where the player could walk through things\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Major player conversation choice improvements to many conversations across the entire narrative. In addition to being able to say new things to almost everyone, most convos can now be easily ended by players choosing to say a natural “ending” line. Convos with Kiril, Rook 13, Pawn 44, Knight 15, Pawn 12, Pawn 4, Knight 18, Pawn 24, Pawn 32, Rook 9, Pawn 64, Pawn 11, Pawn 19, the Consortium Queen, Pawn 62, Pawn 51, Rook 25, Petar, the Consortium King have all received this treatment.\n\n-C3800 Defense Minigame FX now complete. Explosions and related FX all polished up, now make more use of bloom. \n\n-New lounge advertisements!  More ads now show in the rotation in the Zenlil Lounge. Developing…\n\n-Completed major choreography polish pass to all of the mission ops ensemble “Holo Kiril” conversations. R25, K15 and R13 are now more present in all scenes. Major eye movement improvements for everyone.\n\nVirtual Trainer editor:\n- Fixed selections in the drop down menus not always showing what was actually suppose to be selected (a bunch of edge cases fixed here)\n- Completely redid the layout of the VT editor front end window which greatly reduces how cluttered it used to be and makes it read better\n- Setup most controller navigation in the VT editor front end window.\n\n-New ending:  Big Quantum Limbo 3 changes. Major landscape changes/improvements, more fleshed out.  Developing…\n\n-Updated/finished intro “partial dream” sequence in B6’s cabin.\n\n-Credits video updated.

Saves made with CONSORTIUM Remastered Playtest will now load with CONSORTIUM VR!\n- Time dilation no longer occurs in the radial or bishop menu when weapon safety is active. This will reduce the times when voice lines can do a little erroneous repeating at the end plus dilation isn't needed when the Bishop isn't in danger. A proper solution to the voice repeating is in the works.\n- The zenlil map is back at the stations located at forward deck 2, the lounge, the barracks, and the med bay. You can now click locations on the Zenlil map to show floor indicators to that room\n- Added a new “cast member” selection screen for selecting traitor.  \n-Per player feedback, players now have many different lines to end conversations with Rook 25, Rook 9, Pawn 19 and Pawn 32.

Easy mode is less..  More chaos/randomness added throughout all modes.\n-Added system where if player is continuously holding down fire button, lasers will automatically fire at incoming targetted missiles every 0.25 seconds. Player must rapid fire trigger to blast new targets any faster.\n-Various balancing improvements\n-Improvements to how the fight ends - now on Hard, all combatants will stay and fight, no more fleeing.\n-Higher upper limit of F35 missile firing frequency established and hooked up to if players kill 15 or more Fighters with lasers and are playing on hard.

Killing guys vs incapping rewards higher payouts, saving civilians rewards.

Other things will be added in the future.\n- Fixed talk anywhere ISS dialogs getting stuck on where an AI was standing when they were removed from the world. Happened a lot at the end of rescuing hostages.\n- Added being able to set the initial Utility energy the player starts with in a custom VT editor level\n- Fixed squad setting not working for characters in the VT editor levels\n- Added \"exit\" and \"hiding spot\" AI nodes to the VT editor for use by the civilian AIs\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Hopeful fix for steam achievements not firing.\n- NPC chair sit animations now pause once they are in the idle state to prevent the animation from continuing off the end at some point and ejecting the NPC (fixing the “NPCs floating near their chairs” issue many have reported - thank-you!).\n- Fixed getting stuck in chairs (cockpit chair most likely but any non-rotating chair was possible). This was a regression caused by the new vehicle driving code used by rotating chairs.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n- Kirils name in subtitle will now be kiril angelov, not Homeless mercs leader.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Language setting is now enabled, English and Spanish (V.O.I.C.E. supported). Only the core interface and first half of the story is translated to Spanish, we’re still working on the rest.\n-Choreography finishing - Final entire Queen/K15/K18/Player convo animation polish pass has been completed.\n-Major player choice edits and choreography improvements to final Kiril conversation and various other spots in the later half of the narrative.\n- Added new \"gameplay\" settings in front-end.\n- Added \"show character alignment changes\" option to the gameplay section. When on, all alignment changes (ISS or otherwise) will be shown as a HUD indicator (VR and flatscreen).\n- Added toggle to disable animating textures which in turn turns off the texture streaming to the game settings (this is for a test for Harlock’s machine).

This may affect performance in certain circumstances, we are still investigating.\n\nC3800 DEFENSE MINIGAME:\n-Fixed missing lasers in C3800 Defense Minigame (finally!)\n-Fixed issue where most fighter gun-fire wasn't actually hitting C3800.\n-Fixed erroneous disabled fighter sometimes appearing right beside player position even if no EMP missiles were fired.\n-Fixed locked crosshair staying on even after destroying missiles.\n-Fixed explosion particles FX disappearing before finishing.\n-Fixed issue where shields could stop charging entirely.\n-Vastly improved how the various shield charging timers turn on and off (low, emergency and normal modes)\n-Previously locked on Fighters will now instantly re-lock and set the current target for the colliding AimingDevice.\n-Added fighter fight music cue and set to music channel that turns on and loops during the sequence of using the manual weapons to defend Zenlil from attack.\n-Improvements to use of targetting widget: now locked Fighters should immediately show as \"locked\" when becoming the current target\n-A bunch of general improvements and refinements to targetting and targetting priority for choosing what the \"current target\" should be. Incoming Missiles are always highest target priority in general.\n-Changed up one attack sequence so that incoming missile vectors are more visible.\n-Fixed issue where one fighter was being erroneously used for 3 sequences, resulting in very broken looking flight-paths\n-Made the targeting cylinder 50% thinner, allowing for the needed targeting precision. Now there is just one collision cylinder for both VR and flatscreen mode (it was dumb to seperate them in the first place).\n-Slightly boosted C3800 shield damage of incoming gunfire and missile explosions.\n\n-General improvements and polish to conversation options and choreography across the last half of the narrative. The King convo in particular got a big pass, and the Queen/K18 convo choreography is measurably closer to done…\""

We are working to keep up with the fixes as all you amazing people find and divert our attention to the issues you’ve found when playing.\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Fixed the NON-PROGRESSION bug that did occur for many after downing the traitor. (fixed ISS OnCompleteGoto testing abandon logic before the next group was ready causing abandon distances to fire when they shouldn't)  \n- re-hooked up zenlil wings inputs to the wings, this fixes the primary engine state and turbulence animations\n- fixed not being able to pickup from pawn32s body after a save / restore\n- point_alignment ents no longer require the cast member to exist to function. Fixes queen alignment sets and maybe others.\n-Removed logic that was mysteriously closing a brig privacy shield just as a fight is about to start with Kiril's mercs.\n\nMajor Virtual Trainer tutorial fixes:\n-Fixed non-progression that could occur. \n-Re-scripted the CEAR tutorial - game now forces players to incap the first wav, or they will respawn forever. \n-Fixed broken non-VR secondary fire instructions (all that is required now is calling out the assigned button press for secondary fire along with the HUD hint). \n-Fixed overlapping R25 lines.\n-Added black outlines around words in Basic Tutorial scoreboard\n-Energy Tutorial now comes first for players, before the Bishop training scenario hosted by Rook 25.\n\n\nTWEAKS:\n\n- removed redundant/dedicated recycle button\n-CEAR Sonic Wave tweak - balance oif it is now perfect/done. Players have fine control now over how much force to exert on non-shielded enemies, so players can see the various stages the AI can get into.\n-Added black outlines around words in Basic Tutorial scoreboard\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n-Various improvements to conversations throughout the last half of the game.\n\n-New Ending work: Stream polishing pass in progress for the Briefing.

The saved room state in the save data wasn't always 100% because of physics engine noise so I just do a re-check at load time and set the active rooms accordingly. This fixes saving right on room boundaries causing rooms to become invisible because the player was already overlapping them.\n- fixed alignment change indication not happening when entering the alignments menu.
