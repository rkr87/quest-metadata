        "description": "CONSORTIUM VR is both a complete Unreal Engine remaster of Game One of the iDGi-1 Trilogy (CONSORTIUM 2014) and a full adaptation of the work to what weâ€™re calling VR Interactive Cinema. \n\nUse our interdimensional satellite, iDGi-1, to inhabit the mind of a newly commissioned officer of the Consortium: an unparalleled peacekeeping force tasked with maintaining global unity while protecting the Earth's environment.\n\n-Introducing V.O.I.C.E: You may use your own voice to engage with a diverse cast of over 20 characters. Navigate a nuanced murder mystery with some potential action that makes up a deeply interactive, 6-10 hour campaign of Game One of the iDGi-1 Trilogy. \n\n-Access an in-world Information Console containing over a hundred articles of history, chracter back-stories and world events. \n\n-Freely explore the Consortium Command vessel C-3800-D ZENLIL. Decide to embrace diplomacy and navigate the narrative without ever even raising a weapon, or choose more violent approaches and utilize assault weapons to kill or incapacitate your enemies. Choose to talk to everyone or choose to be a person of few words. \n\n-Control an array of weapons, protective gear, medical equipment and more entirely via interactive screens that line your virtual arms. \n\n-Explore and play many different gameplay scenarios within the Virtual Trainer (VT) and even make your own VT levels with our built-for-VR VT editor! Share your levels with the world with built-in modding support.\n",
