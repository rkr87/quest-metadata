        "description": "The ultimate low poly 3D modeling tool! Sketch out your lines and surfaces like drawing on paper, then use a few key tools to add color, detail and modify. Simple, intuitive tools keep you focused and creative - then export a clean, game-ready mesh for prototypes, 3D printing, or just getting creative from the couch.\n\nWe've found Polysketch is great for:\n\n~Game dev and prototyping (Unity, Unreal, etc)\n~Custom objects and worlds in VR Chat and Roblox\n~Tabletop game creatures and props, to be 3D printed\n~Concept art paintovers\n\nInstead of many complex tools, Polysketch focuses on simple, natural 3D sketching to create your shapes. It's like paper, but simpler because you don't have to learn perspective ;)\n\nYou can export your creations as standard \"OBJ\" files for use in almost any app (Unity, Blender, etc). Even better, the line-sketching method ensures a clean and game-ready 3D mesh, so you can use it right away!",

Used to find images as reference images to help your drawing. Browse all images found in above mentioned folders. Select an image to make it active. Pulling down on the thumb stick will grant quick-access to a zoomed-in view of the active image. Clicking the active image (when zoomed in) will place it in the scene.\n- - Incomplete Features. A place for us to put some features that are rough for now. We'll use this space for user testing, or when making a feature that isn't quite ready for mass consumption.  Currently the only feature here is toggling visiblity of any found reference models."

Undo once will undo the face change but not the line. Second undo will undo the line as well.\n- Fixed bug where converting from the two-file save (icon's separate) to one file lost the old icon.\n- Fixed bug where exports were scaled & rotated based on your view of them in the scene rather than their actual transform."
