Used to find images as reference images to help your drawing. Browse all images found in above mentioned folders. Select an image to make it active. Pulling down on the thumb stick will grant quick-access to a zoomed-in view of the active image. Clicking the active image (when zoomed in) will place it in the scene.\n- - Incomplete Features.

Undo once will undo the face change but not the line.
