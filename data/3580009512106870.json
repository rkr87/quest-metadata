        "description": "Alright, we can do this in two ways. \n\nWe can tell you about a story rich 4-player co-op campaign, the Municipal Mayhem™, dozens of guns, a myriad of attachments, skins, masks, deathmatch, tournament ladders, minigames, leaderboards, climbing, graffiti, hidden rewards, the GNOP, bossfights, free updates, dedicated customer support, and so on. \n\nOr, we can tell you what it’s really about: \n\nJaguar blood, gunpowder pheromone, treasure chest musk, gun oil bite, winning lottery ticket crumple, last bullet adrenaline, high fives, f*** yeahs, burning rubber, superhero-landing on dust. \n\nThe world’s about to end, and you can give it a final push. Rob a train, screw up, go on a grand adventure full of grit and juice, blow up the streets, earn a bounty on your head, and keep the engine running. Join Frank, Cody, Udo, and Kevin, four misfits out to get rich or kill anyone else trying. \n\nCome play Gambit!",

                "change_log": "# CHANGELOG\n\n## CRASH FIXES\n\n- Fixed a crash caused by dropping loaded ammo from the Ammo holster while the other hand was also in the same holster.\n- If a player tried to revive a teammate while pulling out a weapon from the holster with their other hand, the game could crash. We fixed it!\n- If Cody switched his Gun Fever weapon (bow) from one hand to the other and shot, the game could crash. We fixed that too!\n\n## GAMEPLAY FIXES\n\n- Significantly improved hit registration on the enemies.\n- Fixed an issue where, upon dying during a superhero landing, the player’s weapons would freeze in mid-air.\n- We significantly reduced the chance of checkpoints not activating when entering shelters.\n- Fixed an issue where the hand holding a grenade in the holster would left the holster UI floating in mid-air when moving backwards.\n- Enemies are now more agile and spend less time standing around.\n- Fixed an issue on the last level where the Rocket Witch’s release lever could cause the player’s hand pose to freeze when released and then picked up again.\n- We fixed the occasionally imperfect hit registration of the Bet Bot armour plates.\n- We have removed the possibility for players to jump out of bounds or get to areas outside of the game area on five different level segments.\n- Fixed an issue where characters could not be switched while using the Switch-U playing in Seated Mode and standing up suddenly in real life.\n- Fixed an issue where the Gun Fever weapon could get stuck in mid-air when used while hanging from a Belay Device.\n- Players can no longer shoot themselves or be hit by their own bullets.\n- Fixed an issue where the Recall button in the Mask Rack wouldn’t recall Charms already attached to weapons.\n- Adjusted floating climbing pipes that were not properly attached to the ceiling on the first level’s Inner City Blues section.\n\n## MULTIPLAYER FIXES\n\n- We significantly reduced the occurrence of stuck game sessions.\n- Fixed a grip issue on the valves, which caused the player’s hand pose to freeze when moving backwards.\n- We fixed an issue where the chained doors could be opened alone, but players couldn’t pass through them. Now, two players need to work together to pull the two chains to open these doors.\n- Fixed an issue where, after switching characters, the player could see duplicated pistol holster UI, stuck in the Switch-U booth and floating in mid-air.\n- It is no longer possible to get stuck in a lane already occupied by another player in the Grip Emporium.\n- Invite can now only be accepted after completing the Tutorial, preventing players from entering the game unarmed.\n- A text feedback with a sound notification is now displayed in the upper left corner when an Invite has been successfully sent.\n- The overlapping buttons in the Friend list in the Options menu have been fixed.\n- The game now unlocks the Stag mask in the Armory as intended.\n- Previously unlocked rewards are now available to players who had earned them but didn’t receive them.\n- The Municipal Mayhem™ Results screen now displays the first two places, even if the player finished in the 3rd or 4th place (when the first two places have not been determined yet).\n\n## MISC FIXES\n\n- Fixed a room-scale exploit where the player could spawn outside the level (and fall off the map) when taking off, then putting on their headset again.\n- We fixed the control issues present in the controller-oriented mode.\n- We fixed an issue where the counter on the door in the Lobby (which was meant to measure the Total Play Time), could reset after restarting the game.\n- We changed the colour of the partially collected items displayed in the Shelters’ Swag-O-Tron, making it much more noticeable if the player missed something."
