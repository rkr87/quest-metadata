So we've added some of the classics back in. We have big plans for sharing and viewing artwork so this is just the start.\n- Add a button in Setting to switch handedness: Previously the only way to do this was to tap the bottom of the controllers together. This wasn't easy to discover and was unreliable when using some controllers.  We've kept that in but added a nice clear button the app settings.\n- Add a button in Setting to reset the \"First Time Use\" tutorial: This is something that's especially useful when you want to demo Open Brush to a new user. The current tutorial is very brief but we hope to expand it in the future. Note this button affects the app the next time you launch it.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n- Meta Quest: Incorrect or missing video thumbnails are shown\n- Meta Quest: Gif capture results in just a black image\n- Meta Quest (Quest 1 only): Selection and erase tools are not working\n\n​\n​"

This also works with the LIV for Quest beta!\n\nFixes\n- Block Poly on Quest 1. Sadly Poly was causing crashes on Quest 1, and due to the short time that Poly will be available, we have chosen to block access. Poly downloads will still work on Quest 2 until the service shuts down. We are creating a Poly replacement service called Icosa Gallery, and once it is up and running we'll make sure Quest 1 (and 2!) will have full support for it!\n- Uploads to SketchFab are now tagged with Open Brush as the creation tool."
