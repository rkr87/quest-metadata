        "description": "Dino Roaryal is an arcade fighting arena VR experience where the player is put in the perceptive of riding a dinosaur and battling their enemies. During the ancient times when Nephilim walked the earth, Dino Roaryal is the story and gameplay of giant men riding on dinosaurs (T-rex) and fighting those dinosaurs in order to conquer their enemies. In a case where your T-rex's health get low, the game offers different spawns to help recorder health and projectile power.\n\nDino Roaryal is best played sitting. Standing positions are also okay but are not recommended as they limit the player's view. Dino Roaryal offers the player a different experience through the Oculus Goggles than the normal VR Pawn experience. ",
