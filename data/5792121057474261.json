        "description": "Time Titans VR is a singleplayer action shooter that allows the user to manually slow down time to get an advantage in combat. Shoot, punch and slice through enemies while slowing down time to unleash mayhem or dodge counter attacks. \n\nSlow time at the push of a button while you move freely to wreak havoc on the opposition. \n\nGun down enemies during the slow motion bliss. \n\nBash your enemies to pieces with maces, battleaxes, sais, swords and an assortment of other melee weapons.\n\nTest your moral compass as you're put through simulated ethical dilemmas to see if you're worthy of joining \"The Corporation\" to work as a mercenary. Your decisions will impact the story and determine if  you get the job after the grueling interview process. \n\nAre you the right fit for the job? Find out. \n",
