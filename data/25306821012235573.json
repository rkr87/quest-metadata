        "description": "SketchUp is the most popular 3D modeling tool for architects, designers, engineers, and hobbyists. Now you can unlock the power of SketchUp in VR. Visualize the models you have created in SketchUp desktop, mobile, and web with your favorite Quest device. By bringing SketchUp on the Quest platform we enable our users to accomplish more meaningful tasks in their design process, collaborate more effectively with other stakeholders, and win more work by leveraging easy-to-use and easy-to-access immersive technology. \nSketchUp Viewer Beta is the testing sandbox of the official SketchUp Viewer app that you can find in the Quest Store. Ahead of our production releases, we will leverage this Beta version for testing within Meta Quest's App Lab environment, where you can get glimpses of what we are working on next and provide feedback.",
