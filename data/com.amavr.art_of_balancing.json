        "description": "Atop the sea of clouds, there exists a garden where the past and present intersect. A space designed to preserve our collective story. But decades of neglect have left the garden barren and forgotten. Now it is up to you to restore our connection to the past by creating rock sculptures that anchor our absent-minded world.\n\nIn Art of Balancing, you are a rock balancer making your way up a mountain in search of the garden. Along the way, you create rock sculptures. Picking up stones, you feel their weight, hear their voice, and find their balance. A collection of carefully thought out prompts will then guide you to reflect on your past and embed your personal story into the stone.",
