        "description": "Marshal Mannerheim’s Saloon Car is the train carriage that was used by Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and his personnel in 1939-1946. Mannerheim was the commander-in-chief of Finland’s defense forces during World War II, and later he became the president of Finland. During the winter war between Finland and Soviet Union, Mannerheim traveled nearly 79 000 kilometers with the train. This historical train carriage is currently located in Mikkeli, Finland, where it can be visited once a year on June 4th.\n\nThis application allows its users to visit Mannerheim’s Saloon Car in VR and to explore old items, documents, photo albums, film clips, and even listen to historical radio broadcasts. It is possible to choose from two languages: English or Finnish. The app was developed by South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences in the ARMikkeli project. The project was partially funded by the South Savo Regional Council from the European Regional Development Fund.",
