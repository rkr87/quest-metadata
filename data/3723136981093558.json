        "description": "*The Paper Birds story continues with the addition of  PART TWO.*  Paper Birds (Part I & II) is a 30 minute interactive story about a young musician in search of true inspiration. Starring Ed Norton, Joss Stone, and Archie Yates, this VR film offers  unique moments of interactivity with hand tracking, inviting you  to conduct music, unlock portals, light up the invisible world, and more.   \n\nIn Part Two, Toto journeys deeper into the invisible world to rescue his sister Azul, discovering more about himself and his family as he travels further.\n\nThis experience premiered at Tribeca Film Festival 2021 and La Biennale di Venezia in 2020. This film is brought to you by 3dar, the creators of Gloomy Eyes.\n\nRecommendations: \nItâ€™s highly recommended to watch the full experience at once. \nMusic is a big part of this experience. We suggest using headphones.\nDialogue is audible and can be heard better by getting closer to the characters.\nEnabling hand tracking is highly recommended. ",
