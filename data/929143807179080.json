Unfortunately we had to re-record one series after it didn't meet our quality standards. We're hopeful to see these go live in the next update.\n\n– Future Plans –\nWe have over 50 new 5k stereo environments that will be launching in the coming weeks, all 100% free. From underwater, to the shores of numerous virtual tropical beaches, and beyond.\n\n– Guided Tai Chi –\nHave an Oculus Quest?

Five years ago this week, during an eerily similar snowstorm, we decided to make a virtual reality beach to escape. That funny side project was the start of the app you're exploring today. You never know what a random day might bring!\n\nThis evening's update (v 3.1.37) to Guided Meditation VR is the first launch in our 2019 roadmap.\n\n– Global Language Support –\n\nToday, we're excited to launch audio meditations in three new languages: Chinese, French, and Japanese. We hope you enjoy over 8 hours of new meditation content in the Zen, Focus, and Depression series. In the coming weeks we'll continue expand these libraries, while adding in Spanish and German audio meditations as well as completely new meditation series content.\n\nTo use these languages please select Custom Meditation > Guided Audio Meditation and choose a language from the top menu. \n\nAnd an additional reminder, all menus are translated as well. These can be modified in Options > Menu Language.\n\n– Features and Refinements –\n\nThis version brings many often requested ideas. These include:\n\n* Reclining Mode. If you're laying down or reclining we now prompt if you'd like to recenter your view. If you select 'Yes' we set your new forward and angle. If 'No' we don't bug you until your next meditation.\n\n* Server Speed. This week we began rolling out server refinements. Our plan is to reduce download times by 2-3x by the end of February through a mixture of software and server enhancements.\n\n* Featured Environment Priority. We now prioritize meditation mixes we've highlighted in the past in Quick Meditation. This ensures that new users get curated, high-quality experiences. Once these featured arrangements are used, we then we return to truly random scenarios.\n\n* Platform Refinements. We spent the past few weeks refining our platform. All Guided apps now use the same scalable core which will be our foundation for instant features across current and future titles.\n\n* Swipe to rotate. Reminder, you can swipe on the Oculus Go controller to rotate 45 degrees in the preferred direction. This lets you enjoy a fresh view very quickly.\n\n* UI improvements. You can now start a featured meditation by clicking the box. No one requested this, but it saved us several seconds of life.\n\n– New Environments –\n\nNext week we'll have a massive environment update, launching more 5k environments than is healthy. These are our best work yet and we hope you enjoy them.\n\n– Hidden Secret –\n\nIf you read this far, you're special. So special we'll let you in a on secret: our sister app Guided Relaxation VR goes 100% free on Monday, January 28th, 2019.\n\nThis app uses original stereo 5k video of the world's most relaxing spaces, from Hawaii to Iceland. You can also seamlessly enjoy Podcasts or Audiobooks in VR.\n\nIf you purchased this and feel frustrated by this change to free, please email grvr@cubicleninjas.com with your Oculus receipt email and we'll refund 100% of your money.\n\n– How Can We Help? –\n\nReady to enjoy the weekend? If we can help with any bugs or ideas to make the app a better part of your day, send us an email at gmvr@cubicleninjas.com. \n\nThanks!\n- Guided Meditation VR team"

We've been laboring hard on our end to launch some exciting enhancements in this late Friday update. \n\n– New Environments –\n\nOn the menu this weekend includes:\n\n* Hana Valley (Spot 8) allows you to rest in a fresh bamboo forest, overlooking a beautiful lake. Off in the distance is a massive waterfall and an ancient city around the bend.\n\n* Ripple Island beach has returned from two week's ago, now in full 5k glory and with further enhancements.\n\n* Clouds! Float above the clouds as sun rises to day. Long requested. Finally delivered.\n\n* Mt Huntington’s overlooks a massive forest lake as the sun rises and sets. We kept this in rotation by popular demand.\n\n– Features and Refinements –\n\nWe made several dozen other important improvements! These include:\n\n* Improved Carmack VR Player. We've made enhancements to the player which allow us to select a region of greater visual fidelity based on the stereo needs of that environment. You can see this in Ripple Island Sunset by looking down. :)\n\n* Environment sorter update. You can now sort environments by 5k Stereo, Random, All, or previously downloaded.\n\n* Swipe to rotate. You can now swipe on the Oculus Go controller to rotate 45 degrees in the preferred direction. This let's you enjoy a fresh view very quickly.\n\n* Updating the Relaxation Series to show all ten meditation, which was not displaying properly due to a bug.\n\n* Improved offline support. We'll only recommend timer if no content has been previously downloaded. If you have downloaded meditations only these will be displayed.\n\n* Loader improvements. Slowed down the 360 photos when downloading content so it is less disorienting. We also are testing a background downloader in this build, for potential uses in the future.\n\n* Environment improvements. We made a floating panda sit and clouds less derpy.\n\n* UI improvements.

Our plan will be to release 5k editions of our past environments from here on (which finally explains why we've been holding on re-releasing a few older ones). But in the meantime, we hope you love the massive leap in visual fidelity as much as we do!\n\n* Please note, 5k is only currently available for Oculus Go users. Gear VR users will still enjoy the new environments, just not in 5k.\n\n– Fresh Environments –\n\nToday also marks the debut of four new meditation spots! These were custom built to make you smile.\n\n* New Leaf is your very own private, magical redwood forest hideaway.\n* Ripple Island’s lush foliage helps you refresh in the crisp jungle shade, just steps away from a toasty beach.\n* Hana Valley’s new spot places you under a cherry blossom tree on a small island in Japan, which overlooks a massive waterfall.\n* Mt Huntington’s new meditation space overlooks a massive forest lake as the sun rises and sets.\n\n– How Is Your Day? –\n\nAre you feeling solid today?
