        "description": "SkydiveSim brings the thrill of skydiving and BASE jumping to your Oculus Quest headset. No more waiting on weather on bad weather days. Put on your headset and choose from our gorgeous levels. Jump from a plane 10,000 feet above ground. Challenge yourself to go through the free fall rings. Then pull your ripcord and fly under the canopy and finally work on your accuracy and  land on the target. You don't need a plane ride back up, just repeat in the same scene or choose another one of our exotics environments to jump into.\nWant even more  excitement? Jump from top of the buildings at night and navigate your way between buildings to your choice of landing area!",
