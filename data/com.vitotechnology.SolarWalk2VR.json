        "description": "Solar Walk VR offers an interactive encyclopedia of the solar system seen as never before. Based on real physics and latest photographic data, Solar Walk VR comes to life with stunning visual effects of planetary atmospheres, solar flares, auroras and asteroid belts to give the space depth.\n\nThe Solar System model made with the help of VR technology lets you navigate between planets, see their positions, explore how they move. Every planet has extensive information: size, mass, orbital velocity, exploratory missions, thickness of structural layers, and composition of atmosphere.\n\n\nThe Sounds\nSolar Walk can be enjoyed using with sounds, put on the headphones and dive into the outer Space moving from one planet to another.\n\nThe Textures\nWe collected the latest textures available to human race to date and integrated them beautifully. Photos acquired during the latest mission to Pluto are already in the app, making it the most fresh and up-to-date space simulator.",
