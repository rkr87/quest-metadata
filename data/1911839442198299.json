This works in the Portal, Re-act, Relax8 only. Memorize and Rotate work only in a regular sitting position. Luna has her own lying down feature (using the lying down button).\n\n- Visual improvements â€“ environments look better in Relax8.\n\n- Sound effects â€“ Many sound effects added improving the VR experience.\n\n- Performance improvements!\n\n- Bug fixes."
