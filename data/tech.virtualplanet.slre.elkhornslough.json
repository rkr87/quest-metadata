        "description": "As coastal communities contend with sea level rise, coastal erosion, and other impacts of climate change, public education has become a critical piece of the puzzle., Virtual Planet Technologies produces highly creative and insightful experiences VR experiences that communities can use to better understand the impacts of climate change and explore emerging adaptation solutions. Our team has a range of expertise from climate scientists, city planners, communications experts, filmmakers, 3D animators, and Unity (software) developers. In our Sea Level Rise Explorer, users interact with 3D models and can raise sea levels to observe potential flooding in real time. Adaptation scenarios can also be displayed.",
