        "description": "Tiny Castles is an \"action puzzle game\" built from the ground up using hand-tracking. It's an experimental project developed internally at Oculus to test necessary interactions for a hands-only game experience.\n\nIn the game, you play as a powerful god. The game's objective is simple - free your \"believers\" from the evil god and his minions and advance forward to destroy the obelisk which powers the evil in this world. The game was built to identify the types of game mechanics that could work well with hand-tracking. For this reason, it lacks real challenge and difficulty balancing and focuses more on showcasing a variety of hand interactions instead.\n\nIncluded is the \"Playground\" level which is the best place to experience all of the game mechanics in an isolated setting while the actual game levels demonstrate these mechanics in real game scenarios.",
