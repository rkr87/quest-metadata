You will experience the events unfold in a completely immersive way and feel like you are a part of the ancient world.\nThe construction of the cathedral is captured step by step from the ground to the opening of the cathedral once completed. In addition, you will be thrilled by the panoramic view of medieval Paris. It is an incredible experience that captures every bit of information surrounding the history and myths of the Cathedral of Notre dame and that of Paris. The cathedral Notre-Dame gets more visitors than the Eiffel Tower and is also listed as a world heritage site by UNESCO due to its rich history.
