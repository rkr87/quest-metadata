        "description": "Ouija Mourning is an encounter with the unknown. In the dark corners of the mansion, the spirits are waiting, listening to every question you dare to ask. The Ouija board is your link, but also your curse. Each time you reach out, they respond. Each time you listen, you invite them closer.\n\nPrepare for a journey where fear is your only guide. The spirits will toy with you, revealing whispers of a past steeped in tragedy. But remember—some answers are not meant to be found. The further you push, the deeper you fall into their grasp. The air thickens with dread as you realize you are no longer in control. You’ve opened a door, and now the spirits refuse to let you close it.\n\nIn Ouija Mourning, it’s not just about solving a mystery—it’s about surviving the terror that follows you with every question. The board is watching, the spirits are restless, and the darkness is relentless. Will you have the courage to face what’s coming, or will the spirits claim you as their own?\n\nEnter if you must—but know that once the board moves, nothing will ever be the same.",
