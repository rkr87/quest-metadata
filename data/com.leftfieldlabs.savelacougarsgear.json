        "description": "Did you know there is a mountain lion living in the middle of Los Angeles? In this VR experience you’ll meet P-22, the most famous cougar in the world.\n\nP-22 crossed two of LA’s infamous freeways to find a new home, and is now trapped by traffic and separated from others of his kind. His plight as a lonely bachelor has inspired people all over the world to help all the mountain lions living in the Los Angeles area, who are facing extinction, by building the largest wildlife crossing in the world over one of the busiest freeways in the country.\n\nIn this VR app, you’ll see LA through a mountain lion’s eyes, and also get a glimpse of what the proposed wildlife crossing will look like.\n \nProduced by Pacific Virtual Reality for the National Wildlife Federation’s #SaveLACougars campaign - learn more and get involved at www.savelacougars.org",
