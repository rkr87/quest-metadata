        "description": "【Own An Island Here】\nMageCosmos is an open world where your adventures are unlimited. Your incredible journey starts on a magical floating island with your own cozy house on it, like everybody else. Looking around, you will find neighbors living on the same island as you do. This is a HUGE world!\n\n【Farm&Factory, Keep It Running】\nYour life on the island depends pretty much on how you manage it. You have a big farm to grow various plants, feed animals, use your harvest to manufacture new items, and complete orders requested over the community to get huge amounts of MageCoins in return while having fun! \n\n【Friends With Neighbors, Even Not With Real Human】\nSpeaking of that, friends are important or it'll be so lonely in such a big world, shake hands with whoever you meet to become friends with and send gifts to them. You can also use a small rocket, fly around and explore the islands. Some AI live there and they're desperate to meet visitors, ask them anything you want!\n\n【Mini-Games And Worlds】\nAs is implied in the name \"Cosmos\", we are creating diverse styles of worlds to travel across, and party games for you and your friends to play together...It's going to be fun!",
