        "description": "You wake up in a cell in the Triton Institute, an experimental asylum headed by the decorated psychologist, Dr. Matthew Simmons. Recently, there have been rumors of abuse and inhuman working conditions within the clinic; furthermore, it seems most of the staff has gone missing. Nobody knows any details, except this: Dr. Simmons has been conducting research into the tripartite psyche, as proposed by Freud, and how to break someone's id, ego and superego apart. How far has he gone?\n\nIn this short but intense VR experience, interactive physics-based puzzles mixed with survival horror elements bring an immersive atmosphere of tension and relief.\nAre you ready to survive in this strange place?\n\n\n\n",

As a small team of 2 people, we try to do our best to improve the game experience for you. Therefore, these are the changes for the first week patch:\n\nImprovements\n- Ammo has a separete holster now, so you don't have to use your 4 inventory slots with that. Store the ammo box when you get it and when you have the pistol in your hand a new slot will appear to spawn ammo for you.\n- Accessibility Options: you can now Calibrate the Height using the menu to change between sitted and standing. Just stay in the position you want to play and click the button\n- Accessibility Options: you can now virtual crouch using the second button on the right controller\n- Accessibility Options: you can choose Toggle Grip, to avoid the need to hold the objects while in your hand\n- Accessibility Options: tutorial screen in the beggining and in the menu to help undertand commands and inventory slots\n- Standardize Remote Grab: we are aware that some objects have different remote grab distance. This was by design to avoid key itens to be easily found, but as it causes more confusion than the desired experience, we decided to standardize the distance\n\n\nBug Fixes\n- Fix save system: some quests were not properly saved and could lead to repeat sentences\n- Cutscene initiating on every load: specifc scene was being trigged on load making the player hear things they shouldn't\n- Remote Grab making objects fly: if you remote grab something and cancel the grab, the object would fly in the direction of your hand. - \nNow we cancel that movement and the object remains in place after the cancel\n- Sheetrack material changed to match cupboard\n- Fixed marker hand position\n- Fixed subtitle not hiding after enemy is killed\n\n\nThat's all. Next week we'll work on improvements for combat system, Enemy AI and animations. Stay tuned and have great weekend"
