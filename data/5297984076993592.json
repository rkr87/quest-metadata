        "description": "Virtual Home Simulation (VHS), is a VR simulation tool that offers a fully-immersive VR experience for repeated skills practice for child welfare workers. VHS allows prospective caseworkers to practice key skills often needed during a home visit; it tests their ability to evaluate a home environment for evidence of risk and protective factors and appropriately document their observations. VHS aims to provide users with the schema development necessary to understand the decision rationale behind the real-world skills emulated in the tool. Preliminary evidence suggests VHS may also serve as a realistic job preview for social workers interested in casework. VHSâ€™s immersive and realistic nature allows the user to assess a home environment while also increasing their awareness regarding their professional or personal fit in the field. Users can practice as often as they like and receive expert feedback during each practice session while their performance is tracked over time.",
