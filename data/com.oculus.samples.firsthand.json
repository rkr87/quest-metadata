        "description": "First Hand is an official Hand Tracking demo built by Meta. Experience the magic of interacting with the virtual world directly with your hands. Use switches, levers, virtual UIs as you solve puzzles to build robotic gloves, and then experience their superpowers. \n\nWe built First Hand to demonstrate the capabilities and the variety of interaction models possible with Hands. This demo is built using the Presence Platformâ€™s Interaction SDK, a library of interaction components, gestures and tools to build magical hand and controller interactions. This demo is also available as an open source project for developers who would like to easily replicate similar interactions.\n\nWe drew inspiration in this demo from First Contact, the original Meta experience showcasing controller interactions.\n",
