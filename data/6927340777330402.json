        "description": "Campfire is the best way to communicate 3D information throughout the physical product lifecycle. Whether you're streamlining design reviews, training, or troubleshooting, Campfire makes it easier than ever.\n\nA NEW APPROACH \nCampfire takes a new approach to 3D collaboration. It's based on the way people communicate most naturally – around things. Instead of sharing screenfuls of CAD, images, and text, you share interactive 3D content with your team around it, even if they're around the globe.\n\nEASY TO USE \nCampfire uses passthrough on Meta Quest to make 3D collaboration feel even more natural. Users see content in front of them, and remote participants around it - even if they're joining from a desktop or mobile device.\n\nSIMPLE & POWERFUL TOOLS \nChoose from powerful tools accessible from a single button. Use the laser pointer to make your point. Use text and sketch annotations to communicate with colleagues in other time zones. Defy the laws of physics with tools like slice, explode, and grab, to show complex concepts simply.\n\n40+ TYPES OF 3D/CAD  \nCreate scenes on the desktop using your existing CAD/3D files. No optimization or coding required. Campfire Cloud optimizes your scenes for Meta Quest automatically and securely.\n\nFREE STARTER PLAN \nCampfire Starter allows you to share 5 projects of 5 scenes with 5 users. Scenes can be created using files up to 25MB in the following formats: FBX, OBJ, GLB/TF, PLY, STL, USD/Z/A/C. Enterprise plans are available at Campfire3d.com. ",

Quest 3’s full color passthrough makes collaboration more natural than ever. We’re also introducing a new tutorial led by Spark, a virtual trainer who explains how to use Campfire tools with a little AI flair. The Quest app also brings the scene list, hierarchy, and inspector into your space to make it easy to present and make quick scene edits along the way.\n- Voice Chat. Campfire continues to work seamlessly alongside Zoom and Teams meetings, but now you can chat directly in Campfire with the click of a button.\n- Library. For enterprise accounts, we’re introducing the library to make it easy to share models between projects and scenes. Add models to the library and use them in any scene or project.\n- Measuring Tool. Quickly measure parts or models by selecting them with the measuring tool. A bounding volume will show measurements on each axis.\n- Model Optimization. For enterprise accounts, you can turn on model optimization to automatically reduce complexity of large models for use on iPad and Quest.\n- Enterprise Admin. For enterprise accounts, admin users can now manage users from a web browser.\n\n**Known Issues**\n\n- Sample projects will take up to 5 minutes to appear in a newly created account\n- Occasionally, enterprise users may encounter a texture mismatch when viewing optimized models on Quest or iPad. This may happen on models with sub-meshes. You can toggle compatibility with Quest or iPad OFF, although performance on these devices may not be optimal.\n- Editing a comment on Quest will erase all the text instead of starting at the end of the text block.\n- Measure tool does not work with animated models on Quest devices\n- Occasionally, the project share screen, will not show all the users the project is currently shared with.\n- Quest and iPad users may experience disruptions in voice chat if the device are left idle. To resume voice chat, simply leave the project and start it again\n\nWe hope these updates and improvements will enhance your experience with Campfire. As always, please let us know if you encounter any issues or have any feedback. Thank you for using Campfire!"
