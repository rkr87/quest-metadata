        "description": "In this XR Hackathon app, you can build your own robot using various modules. Test your robot on obstacle courses and see which design solves them the fastest. Each course presents unique challenges, so you'll need to adjust your robot's design accordingly. This interactive experience allows you to experiment with different configurations, pushing your creativity and problem-solving skills as you strive to create the most efficient robot for each challenge.\n\nWith this prototype, we aim to demonstrate the potential of XR for accessible and scalable STEM education. Teachers can create challenges like mobility, logic, and sensory tasks, while students build and customize their own robots. The app culminates in a collaborative experience where the class watches their robots compete to solve the challenges as quickly as possible, enhancing both learning and engagement in STEM fields.\n\nThere is a plethora of potential additional features to enhance the experience for teachers and students, such as new modules for logic, sensory, and locomotion, in-depth customization of specific components, and innovative challenges. For example, obstacles could require simple programming, like using an automated robotic arm to remove crates from the course, or puzzles that need finely tuned sensors to solve effectively. These additions would further enrich the educational experience.\n\n**XR-Hackathon-Team**\n- Tim Ebert\n- Nigel Hartmann\n- Tank Thunderbird\n- Sebastian Wloch\n- Milan Wulf\n\n",
