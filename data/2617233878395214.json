In addition to general bug fixes this update introduces a new option allowing you to disable automatic body orientation. Now you can rotate your body freely as you leap from one grip to another around one corner to another. You can set this option in the game's menu.\n\nWe are aware that scrolling through the social leaderboard might load in random entries.\n \nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"

As we’ve only had a few complaints about this, we need your help to let us know if this solves the issue from you.\n\nWe know some of you have not been able to participate in the first monthly challenge, and we are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. We are investigating how to address this as a next step once the fix has been confirmed to work.\n\nKnown issue: It might be that the leaderboards show you’re not connected after a Ghost Race but the \"mini profile\" in the middle says you are.\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"

Within this period of time unique themed collectables will spawn in all regular levels, and all you have to do is to collect the set amount to unlock a wristband of the running challenge.\n\nThe first challenge “Harvest” will be live from August 10th to 17th 2021. Challenges will be announced 3 days before they begin in-game (and also will be announced via our social media channels too!) - so no worries you’ll be given ample time to prepare! They’ll reoccur annually too to give you the opportunity to collect’em all if you should miss out one!\n\nIn addition to general bug fixing Update 2.0 also gives you control of how you want to jump in-game: Currently, A-Button and push off can be used at the same time to jump. With Update 2.0 both methods can be selected separately, meaning either only A-Button or only push off. Or, as usual, both at the same time. All of this can be set in the options in-game.\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"

Once you complete them step by step you will receive a new glove as completion reward.\n \nThe Freestyle Expansion Pack leverages the visual language of the Tutorial, and will challenge you in both \"casual\" and \"professional\" modes. The levels of Freestyle Expansion Pack have no checkpoints - and completing them without chalk will get you bonus points.\n\nLast but not least we want to also inform you the average speed and efficiency leaderboards have been removed as part of this update. No worries this wouldn't affect your data in any way.\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"

We’re also introducing rhythm-based climbing where you’ll see disappearing grips along your route, requiring you to learn the grip patterns to the beat of a background track to progress through. You will unlock each of the 6 levels step by step, and once all are completed you will receive a new glove as a completion reward.\n\nLast but not least this update includes general bug fixes as well. We will be monitoring closely what is said, and we will make it to a point to address issues you might encounter as soon as possible.\n\nMajor known issues of this update:\n#1 Game might shut down and restart when returning from Oculus menu (this is a OS related issue!)\n#2 UI breaks when starting a Ghost Race without having a connection to server\n\nWe hope you now have a smoother climbing experience.\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"

We'll have a fix for you soon. \n \n- We've removed the option to disable body orientation as this feature has caused some players to not be able to pull themselves up at checkpoints. We will re-introduce this option at a later date again.\n \n- The issue with the placeholder strings has now been resolved. Disclaimer: If you still see placeholder strings when you launch the game please select any of the supported languages in-game and this will resolve the issue!\n \nLast but not least we are aware that some of you experience flickering and a few occasional crashes. We are monitoring closely what is said, and we will make it to a point to include those fixes with upcoming updates.\n \nWe hope you now have a smoother climbing experience!\n \nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!"
