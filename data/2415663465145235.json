        "description": "Did you know that being in nature helps reduce stress and anxiety, and can improve your short term memory by 20%?  \nBut with the need to stay safe and stay home we can find ourselves missing out on some of the amazing psychological benefits nature has to offer. \nThat’s where Virry can help.  \nMade from 360° filmed environments captured in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, Virry Happy is a series of immersive virtual reality experiences made without any CGI to give you the full therapeutic benefits of nature exposure. \nIn fact, your doctor can now prescribe you Virry to better cope with stress and anxiety because Virry VR is registered as a Class 1 Medical Device (please see Terms of Use for details). \nUse Virry Happy as your daily meditation and mindfulness guide to look after your wellbeing and escape to nature from the safety and comfort of home. \n",
