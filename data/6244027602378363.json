Become the GIANT and battle tiny KNIGHTS online in a variety of maps and game modes.\n\nDAVIGO requires an internet connection and must be played with at least one other person who joins your game on PC. Your opponents can fight you as a KNIGHT on PC by downloading the free DAVIGO KNIGHT'S PASS at davigogame.com/knightspass.\n\nYou are the boss. Unleash devastating power on the puny KNIGHTS with physics-driven, full-body gameplay. Pound the ground, rip trees and stones from the earth, and throw everything you can to leave no KNIGHT standing.\n\nBattle in 7 official maps that will take you from the hellish sacrificial pit of ALTAR to the desolate, snowy peak of SUMMIT. Download custom maps created by other players to continue the fight.\n\nFace off in one of four game modes. BRAWL is DAVIGO's flagship fight to the death, while TOWER and CAPTURE spice up the battle with secondary objectives. CLASSIC recreates the DAVIGO Alpha experience and will challenge you with a limited arsenal.\n\nFeatures\n- Cross-reality combat with 1 VR player and 1-4 PC players\n- Physics-driven full-body gameplay\n- 7 maps and 4 game modes to compete in\n- mod.io support to download custom maps created with the DAVIGO Map Editor\n- Free KNIGHT'S PASS for PC players to battle you online",
