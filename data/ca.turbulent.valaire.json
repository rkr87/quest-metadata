        "description": "Let your mind wander and your body groove as The Coast takes you on a breathtaking musical journey with the Montreal-based group Valaire.\n\nEnjoy their breezy sound as you surf through a vibrant 360 landscape coming alive. With the sun rising over a peculiar beach, the music lifts you off and you slowly escape the tyranny of gravity. \n\nSpiraling gently around a strange moving shape, you’re set for a rhythmic and mesmerizing trip where anything is possible: starfish keep the beat, trumpet flowers resonate and cactus balloons flow along with the tempo. \n\nAs the music goes on and the sun sets, the experience provokes a mystifying sense of happiness and you can’t help but sing in unison “Set us free” while gazing at the starlit sky.\n\nSide effects may include:\n-A heartwarming feeling, but no sunburn. \n-A grin stuck to your face.\n-A strong case of dancing feet.\n\nThe Coast is an experience that showcases the eponymous song by Valaire, from their 2016 album Oobopopop.",
