        "description": "Richie's Plank Experience was designed to invoke the strongest possible emotions in the shortest possible time. Test your fear of heights or entertain your friends and family as they walk the plank 80 stories high and experience terrifying real fear, knees weak and palms sweaty!\n\nThe plank setup has been vastly improved through the use of immersive Mixed Reality on Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro devices. Adjust the position, rotation and dimensions of your in game plank to match your real world plank or create a virtual plank right in your living room!\n\nOnce you have mastered the art of walking the plank, crank it up a notch and see if you can make it through Nightmare mode. Our Halloween themed experience is a great way to scare you and your guests during the spooky season.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it feels like to fly? With our Hero Academy, you can fly through the city like a superhero, take out rockets or fight fires.\n\nWe even have a Christmas themed VR experience the whole family can enjoy. Our Santa Simulator is great for kids and family gatherings during Christmas time.\n\nWarning: This game invokes a near-instant emotional reaction. Due to the nature of virtual reality, this experience can affect your balance, cause dizziness and affect your decision making ability. Follow the in-game Safety Guidelines to reduce the risk of serious injury or harm.",

With option to turn it on and off inside the elevator. \nðŸ”¸Added optional Canyon DLC\n\nCity Graphics Improvements:\nðŸ”¸Stronger fog\nðŸ”¸Fog clamped to max 80% influence.\nðŸ”¸Improved the road textures\nðŸ”¸Much Larger AO distance. This gives nicer AO from whole buildings. Not just nooks.\nðŸ”¸Increase light strength to compensate for larger AO distance.\nðŸ”¸Photoscan elements added under plank top floor and to the right top floor.\nðŸ”¸Lower horizon on sky box.\nðŸ”¸Added mountains to sky box to blend in better with mesh mountains and add extra layer.\nðŸ”¸Scaled down terrain height on Y axis. Didn't think it'd work, but it did! Especially with improved mountains.\nðŸ”¸Removed plants either side of plank on ground floor.\nðŸ”¸Made elevator use light probes instead of light bake.\nðŸ”¸Added light casting on to ground from the elevator.\nðŸ”¸Added more vertex colouring to more buildings.\nðŸ”¸Added tree back in the park.\nðŸ”¸More clouds at various heights between plank and ground.\nðŸ”¸Desaturated colours in atlas texture.\nðŸ”¸Changed some of the old building textures to more modern glass building layouts. Main one was building to the immediate left of the plank.\nðŸ”¸Added better noise detail to the normal map for glass of buildings. This gives the bowing glass effect that happens in real life. Either from wind or from age or from mounting flex.\nðŸ”¸Added slight variation to the base normal map colour of some windows using photoshop. This adds a slight variation in angle to the base layer of each pane of glass. This simulates the slight variation in mounting angle of glass. This added a weakness of some showing relfection as smaller or bigger sometimes. I feel like the benefit still outweighed this negative.\nðŸ”¸Added bin to the right of ground floor to hide weaknesses in the building join.\nðŸ”¸Added low fence to the park. Huge improvement!\nðŸ”¸Added low railing to roofs of buildings closest to the plank.\nðŸ”¸Reduced overhang of building across from plank. This exposes more nice glass.\nðŸ”¸3x higher quality light bake.\nðŸ”¸Added more fake shadows to break up boring street to the left of the plank.\nðŸ”¸Bigger god ray on top floor. Adjusted colour and strength."
