        "description": "Nanome is the ultimate interface for scientific discovery, starting with molecular data. With Nanome, top R&D labs conduct cutting-edge research but, Nanome isn’t just for experts, it’s also used by students and amateur scientists studying chemistry and biology. Anyone can build 3D molecules or simulate an entire protein made of hundreds of atoms, all in one collaborative environment. Transform the way you learn and design molecular structures with Nanome.\n\nSome features require subscription licenses. Visit nanome.ai for more infomation\n\nFeatures\n•Import molecules from databases\n•Build with any element w/ periodic table\n•View different molecular representations \n•Measure distances & angles\n•Mutate amino acids \n•Flexible python api plugin system for the custom computational integrations\n•In-app web browser, whiteboard, notepad, and camera\n•Spatial Recording: a transformative way to learn chemistry and asynchronously communicate molecular insights\n•Meta Avatars\n•Passthrough MR",

It allows you record and playback collaborative sessions in real-time with others, all while being able to pause at any moment and interact with the environment. We also added a new interactive tutorial system called Nanome basics focusing on controller interactions. This was our largest release to date and is full of incredible features. The full list of features is located at https://nanome.ai/setup and you can get a deep dive on our blog: https://blog.matryx.ai/nanome-1-20-beta-the-new-nanome-tutorial-update-9899743f312"
