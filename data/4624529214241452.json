(clicking it would’ve only brought you to the End Credits scene).\n- Fixed a bug where a player doesn’t receive one of the doctor’s answers which she sends to you.\n- Fixed a bug where clues were sometimes turning blue when placed on the evidence board in multiplayer.\n- Small visual improvements and bugfixes.\n"
