Wield new gadgets, visit action-packed locales, and wear custom disguises as you dive back into the world of espionage in this escape room game.\n\nYour skills - and survival rate - make you one of our most capable agents, and you’ve resurfaced just in time. Zoraxis, our sworn enemy, has something new up its sleeves and we fear there will be dire consequences if we don’t stop its diabolical schemes. We’re counting on you to throw a wrench (or screwdriver) into whatever evil is brewing. Protect the Agency and the world as we know it, without losing your wits…or your life! ☠️\n\n# Race to Beat Dr. Zor\n\nYour assignments take place in some of the most dangerous and expansive locales to date, and each one will require your most advanced covert agent skills. These fast-paced missions will leave you breathless.\n\n# Meet a Brilliant Mastermind\n\nDr. Roxana Prism, scientist and former Agency inventor, believes she can create a better agent, one that’s superior to our human agents. And she has it out for you, Agent. Your mission: stay alive long enough to defeat this new escalating threat. \n\n# Go Undercover in Style\n\nShow off your style (undercover, of course) with an imaginative array of Agency-approved attire. Look smart and choose your favorite hat, watch, and gloves before embarking on your top-secret missions. \n\n**Join our Discord server for all the latest intel!**",
