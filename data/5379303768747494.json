We're back with a mighty update.\n\nv0.22.4\n- Finally fixed the MASSIVE bug that moved/distorted/changed the scene items if you removed your device and it went to sleep. It was definitely annoying when trying to pass your dungeon over to friends and family. Enjoy hassly free dungeon dwelling now!\n\nv0.22.3\n- Meta Spaces is now mandatory for the initial setup. So once you've outlined your walls, and any furniture on your Quest, Dungeon Maker will automatically generate a dungeon framework based on this. Then you can customise to your liking.\n- Color assets for all! Everything is now full color, looks really nice on Quest 3! :)\n- A better selection UI, with outlines and names. So you know what you are selecting and dragging around.\n- And many other quality of life improvements.\n\nQuick tip:\n- I'm going to build a sub menu for quick options, but for now one option which you'll want to use is setting the Meta Scene generated assets like walls and furniture into occlusion. So you can see your real walls/floor/ceiling/couch. For now to do this simply point at a wall for example and pull the grip trigger like you want to grab it. This will toggle between your real wall and the generated wall. So feel free to do this on all the Meta Spaces assets to reveal your home!\n"

So make sure you save your dungeons, you can just load your save again if the scene breaks after sleep. This shouldn't affect passing the device to friends around you, as the device takes 10secs to go to sleep (or if you press the power button). Will issue a fix very soon!"

So be patient as I work on updates regularly Sire!\n\nWorking on this big update brining plenty of improved features:\n- Full color!\n- Uses Meta Spaces so the dungeon template is generate from your home layout automatically. \n- Improved UI and interaction, can see more clearly what you are currently pointing at and how to select. \n- Larger fonts to make everything more legible.\n- And many other quality of life improvements.\n\nKnown issues:\n- If you try to recenter, everything breaks. And I mean everything. So what I've done for now to make things less worse is if you try to recenter it'll just generate a new template from your Spaces. Though you shouldn't recenter, there's no point. It's all spacially anchored! ^^\n- Seems like if you reboot your headset and load a dungeon you saved, the items you placed are not in correct place. It works fine if you don't reboot. If this happens for now just use the MOVE ALL button to move all the items back to original pose. "

If the player enters that area the skeleton will walk towards the player, and attack if they meet.\n- Adjusted grab height for floor items so you can properly select items on top of each other.\n- Updated various bits of audio, some UI elements and anchor design for items."
