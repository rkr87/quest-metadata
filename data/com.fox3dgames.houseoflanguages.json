        "description": "*NEW VERSION* House of Languages VR – is a new way to master English, German or Spanish languages. It is a highly-effective way for learning new vocabulary using several channels of perception in VR:\n* see the object and its corresponding name,\n* hear the name of the object,\n* repeat the name of the object.\n\nWe believe it is the most powerful way to memorize foreign language words.\n\nThere are 10+2 different locations within the app, such as airport, cafe, cinema, zoo, museum, etc. +School!\n\nThe locations contain:\n* useful words for real life conversation,\n* review table with all words from the location,\n* mini-games such as a word guessing test and puzzles.\n\nFriendly little Mr Woo will teach you. You will also get to meet his family and discover his cute world. All the wоrds you need to memorize are just around you.\n\nHouse of Languages - is a beautiful and comfortable VR environment for you to discover, interact, learn and enjoy!\n",
