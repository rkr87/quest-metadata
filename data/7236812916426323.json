        "description": "Anivision is an immersive simulation set in the Bornean Rainforest where players acquire traits of each animal to better survive and hunt in the rainforest. The game currently supports 2 game modes: the tarsier and the pit viper. More game modes will be added as the game continues to evolve.\n\nTarsier: The tarsier is a nocturnal primate that has evolved to hear the ultrasonic frequencies of their prey and see in low-light conditions and with a different color profile. As you continue to hunt one of their main food sources, katydids, you will unlock each of these traits and use them to better hunt and survive.\n\nPit viper: The pit viper is a venomous viper distinguished by their ability to sense heat in the environment. As you continue to eat tarsier prey you will unlock their sense of smell and their distinguishing ability to sense heat signatures through their pit organ. These will help you survive and thrive in the harsh rainforest environment.\nPlayers will be able to understand how each of these adaptations helps the animals seek out prey and navigate their environment by both experiencing them first-hand and learning more through the gameâ€™s interface (e.g., prompts, logs, menus).",
