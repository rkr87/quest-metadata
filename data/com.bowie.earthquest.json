        "description": "# EarthQuest - Changelog v12-13\n\nGreetings, fellow explorers!\n\nI, Bowie (also known as Electrum), am thrilled to present a monumental update that embodies 13 days and nights of relentless dedication and hard work. EarthQuest's version 12 and version 13 is more than just an update; it's a testament to what unwavering determination can achieve.\n\n\n### Clearing the Path\n- This update is so substantial that I had to remove previous changelogs from the main page to make space for the sheer magnitude of changes.\n\n### Street View Integration\nI'm thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level.\n\n### Single Player Mode\n- I've implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience.\n- It's optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).\n\n### Hub for Play Modes\n\n- The new UI now includes a hub where you can seamlessly switch between Play Modes, whether you want to explore solo or join others in multiplayer adventures.\n\n### Room Management\n\n- Players can now easily create or join rooms with room codes.\n- Clear error messages guide you when there's no internet, servers are down, or no room code is provided.",
