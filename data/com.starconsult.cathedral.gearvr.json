Gulielmo Carter, a dauntless reporter, suddenly disappeared after he found the diary.\"\n\nWhere are Allison's parents' corpses kept? \nWhat happened to Guglielmo that night?\n\nTwo years later from \"The Hospital\" facts, you are interested in visiting the place where Rachel and Alfredo should have been buried.  \n\n\"The Cathedral\" is the second chapter of the Allison's Diary horror saga. In the sacred cathedral of Sant'Andrea there is something frightening waiting to be discovered. \nFunerals are not the end: they are just the beginning.",
