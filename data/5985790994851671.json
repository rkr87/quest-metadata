We’ve found it quite surreal launching the game and are super happy it’s in the hands of real players!\n\nWe’ve had feedback around the difficulty curves of the Happy Hour and Hardcore game modes, and we’re making some changes to address that feedback and make the overall baseline difficulty lower than before.\n\nBalancing and Difficulty Changes\n\nThe difficulty now ramps 33% slower in all of the main game modes. This should make the starting periods of each shift more forgiving.\nThe starting difficulty of all of the main game modes is easier by default. For context on the following changes, players need to know that the difficulty ramp causes tasks to happen more frequently as the difficulty increases:\nBeginning task frequency has been decreased from 13 seconds to 16 seconds.\nThe first half of the difficulty ramp now has meaningfully more time between tasks overall, meaning you are less likely to be overwhelmed in the opening minutes of each shift. This also means that the maximum difficulty of the Casual modes has been reduced.\nThe second half of the ramp has been made moderately more forgiving, though should still present ample challenge for our most competitive bartenders.\nIn the Casual modes, failing an order reduces the difficulty for a period of time. For this update a failed order now reduces the difficulty by 2 notches instead of 1 as before. This should provide players with a more noticeable easy period after failing an order.\nGlasses now require more collision velocity to be smashed, making accidental breakages less common:\nCocktail glasses are 50% harder to smash.\nShot and Beer glasses are 25% harder to smash.\nSpirit bottles are 10% harder to smash.\nIn Happy Hour, Normal Casual, and Hardcore game modes, baseline customer patience has been increased:\nFor shots and cocktails, patience has been increased from 27 to 35 seconds.\nFor beers, patience has been increased from 32 to 40 seconds.\nThe dart task timer has been increased in all main game modes:\nIn Casual modes, dart timers have been increased from 25 to 32 seconds.\nIn Happy Hour and Hardcore modes, dart timers have been increased from 17 to 25 seconds.\nIn the Dart Attack mode, dart timers have been slightly increased from 17 to 20 seconds.\nThe soda gun task timer has been increased in all main game modes:\nIn Casual modes, the soda gun timers have been increased from 32 to 35 seconds.\nIn Happy Hour and Hardcore modes, soda gun timers have been increased from 24 to 27 seconds.\nStaring at an NPC to get them to remind you of their order now takes 1 second, reduced from 1.25 seconds.\nNPC orders in speech bubbles now persist for 7 seconds instead of 5 seconds meaning players have 40% longer to recognise a customer order before needing to ask for a reminder.\n\nMisc Changes\n\nFixed a bug that sometimes caused the bell to ring without shaking it."
