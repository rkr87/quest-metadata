        "description": "A demonstration of our Virtual Operations Environment showcasing a traditional security control environment in virtual reality. The demo features a large convention center with numerous camera feeds and sensors. Virtual security guards can quickly access potential issues, get an overview of the entire property, while zeroing in on potential issues quickly and effectively.\n\nLarge physical control rooms contribute to large operational costs. The VizworX Virtual Operations Environment framework assists operations and control centers with their digital transformation. Using powerful visualizations, we can recreate and surpass the tools presented in the traditional control room, with the added benefits of lowering the cognitive load, being lightweight, easier to change, and all with lower operating costs.\n",
