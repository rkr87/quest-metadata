        "description": "With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. \n\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",

Quest 1 users will still have access to Espire 1 version 1.9.202. Note: Espire 1 still supports players that use Quest 1 to play Espire 1 on the PC platform via the PC Link feature.\n\n**Visual improvements**\n- Espire 1 will render at a higher pixel resolution on the Quest 3 headset.\n- Textures for key character, environment and interactable assets have been increased by 4x Quality on the Quest platform. These texture improvements are supported by Quest 2, Quest Pro and Quest 3.\n- The Texture RAM cache has been increased for Quest 2, Quest Pro and Quest 3 to each device’s available RAM.\n- Fixed Foveated Rendering is now set to Dynamic on all Quest devices (Quest Platform only).\n- On the Quest Platform, Espire 1 now uses 4x MSAA instead of 2x MSAA.\n- NPC guards now have much higher resolution meshes and higher quality BPR materials applied to them on the Quest + PC platforms.\n- NPC support staff including IFA scientists and security staff now render with higher resolution meshes and higher quality BPR materials.\n- Mesh + shadow resolution has been increased for many assets throughout the game. Key meshes include primary weapons, Espire cradle units, cradle panels, cradle podiums, doors, large Espire Batteries, Pallets and other common environmental cover.\n- The Hand-mounted “HandCam” and throwable “RemoteCam” holographic camera feeds now have a higher resolution and refresh rate, depending on the current Quest device you are using.\n- Espire 1 now renders more spent bullet casings and empty weapon magazines on all platforms.\n- The holographic waypoint that guides the player to their next objective renders at a higher resolution on the Quest platform.\n- The User Interface across the title renders at a significantly higher resolution.\n- The User interface across the title has been scaled down and repositioned - much easier to read and navigate.\n- In the main menu, additional background visual elements originally designed for the PC platform will now render on the Quest platform.\n- Various Scientist, security and support NPCs have been added to the main menu environment.\n- Espire 1 frames now have full PBR materials on the Quest platform. \n- The ground in the “Militaris” container site levels now renders at a higher quality on the Quest platform.\n\n**Audio Improvements**\n- On the Quest platform, the amount of ‘random’ audio files that can play throughout gameplay has been increased by 3x.\n- For NPC soldiers, a significant amount of previously unheard lines of dialogue have been added.\n- There are now various versions of the main menu background music that will play.\n- Players that complete Espire 1’s campaign on ‘normal’ or ‘hard’ will unlock a unique splash screen music track.\n- Fixed an issue where an NPC guard’s spoken dialogue may not “slow down” when the player slows down time using Espire Instinct. \n\n**Gameplay improvements**\n- Automated Turrets will now trigger a combat alert the moment they detect the player. Note that the automated turret at the very start of mission #1 Espire Labs is configured to not cause a combat alert when detecting the player. \n- Security cameras will now trigger a combat alert far quicker than before and this detection time is again halved in Hard difficulty.\n- Security camera damage logic has been re-written. It will now take multiple shots to destroy the camera. The lens is a weak spot, with a 1 hit destroy for any bullet - including tranq darts. Explosives and other ‘damage causers' are now able to damage security cameras. The player can only destroy a security camera with a tranq dart if the dart hits the camera's lens.\n- The “venting” behaviour for all explosives in the game has been improved - with more random movement and hecticness, based on the explosive mass\n- Green-variant explosive canisters have been removed from the game, replaced with red canisters.\n- Blue explosive barrels are now red.\n\n**Game Content - Polish Pass**\n- All campaign missions have had a significant polish pass, focused on improving lighting & shadow quality, while addressing collision issues & rendering issues.\n- More bodies of fallen IFA security staff and personnel have been added throughout the campaign.\n- All 53+ virtual challenge missions have had a significant polish pass, focused on improving lighting & shadow quality.\n- The Mitrata virtual challenge is now a ‘shared’ mission between PC and Quest platform with various fixes applied to the environment.\n\n**General Fixes**\n- Various animation issues for guards have been found and removed.\n- Fixed an exploit allowing players to cheat in a weekly challenge or standard virtual challenge, completing much of the mission before the mission even begins. This same fix has recently shipped in Espire 2.\n- Fixed an issue in Mission 2: Reech Division where players are able to glitch through a wall and finish the mission early.\n\n**Misc Changes**\n- Espire 1 key art, launch splash screen and icons have been refreshed as part of this update.\n- Espire 1 is now packaged in larger OBB files of up to 4GB. Previously, the game would be packaged into smaller 2GB OBB files.\n- Added a 1.11 news page to the main menu. The news page will now display on the PC platform too. "

                "change_log": "Dear Espire Agents!\n\nWe are very proud to release our 1.4 update for Espire 1: VR Operative!\n\nWith this release, we’ve focused on improving 3 areas of the game: Enemy A.I, Gameplay/UX and, on Quest, Graphical Updates.These updates are live now on Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift and on Steam. They will be coming straight to PSVR asap after Christmas.\n\n\nHere is a summary of the core improvements, with the full release notes below:\n\nAI Improvements\n\nThis has been our core focus above all else in this release. The major improvement in this patch revolves around the enemy A.I’s perception of the player. Guards can now easily spot players if the player is standing, however, the player is far more hidden when crouched. Enemy guards also have a much harder time seeing the player when the player is high up in the rafters now. Their vertical line of sight will increase as the enemy threat level increases into combat. Regarding combat, we’ve spent a lot of time refining their combat routines so they will pose more of a challenge to the player and select better locations in the environment to take up defensive positions. We have fixed a number of A.I issues reported by players.\n\nGameplay / UX\n\nSince launch, we’ve tried our very best to collect and collate all of your feedback on the game. With this patch we’ve tried to include the top user-requested features and changes to the game. We’ve always had 2 different difficulties in Espire and our core game design was: On Espire Agent difficulty (Normal mode) you play the game like a standard FPS if you want to. On VR Operative, Stealth is really your only option. We’ve listened to feedback and tried to refine the difficulty and make these options clearer to players. We have placed Tranq dart ammo magazines throughout every mission in the game. You’ll be able to find them using Espire vision. There’s now a ‘controllers’ menu that lists your controller input mapping and on platforms like Steam, it will update if you switch between Vive wands and Index controllers mid-session. Various “Espire Trials” (these unlock cheats) and mission objectives have been adjusted so they are more easier or more fun to complete.\n\nQuest: Graphics Update!\n\nWith Patch 1.4 we’ve improved the visual quality on the Oculus Quest platform. The major improvement revolves around roughness/reflectivity. Key items in the game (hands, gadgets, weapons, etc) now have roughness and will reflect light. We’ve also improved shadow quality, mesh tri counts, and the resolution fo the game’s User Interface so it appears crisp. This has required a lot of work to ensure the game still meets it’s 72FPS target on the Oculus Quest. In Espire, you have full freedom to ‘throw’ yourself around the environment and view it from any angle while avoiding many enemy threats on-screen, XRay vision and “hand cameras’ that render the entire scene again from a unique viewpoint. These mechanics do strain the Quest a lot, but we continue to further optimize every aspect of the title and this graphics update is only the beginning.\n\nAt Digital Lode and Tripwire, we sincerely thankyou for your support of Espire and wish you a happy holiday period. We have a lot of exciting content updates planned for Espire in 2020 and can’t wait to share more info in the coming year. Your support of this title allows us to continue to develop updates and other content. We listen to people’s reviews and feedback. If you enjoy Espire, we ask you to leave a positive review, it really helps us out! You can reach us any time via our Digital Lode Discord: http://discord.gg/espire1\n\nFull release notes for the Espire 1.4 patch:\n\n\nA.I. Updates\n\n\nAdjusted the A.I. so guards have a harder time spotting the player when they’re at differing heights. For example, when the player is crouching and hiding in the ceiling, with a guard below.\nAdditionally, the ability for a guard to see above and below them will increase or decrease based on the current threat level.\nCompletely revised enemy sightlines. Now the player is easier to spot while standing, but much harder to detect when crouching.\nAdditionally, guards that detect a standing player will lose sight of the player if the player immediately crouches and the guard is still a good distance from the player.\nAdjusted A.I. logic for when they’re in combat with the player so they better balance when to be offensive and defensive.\nAdditionally, guards will be more aggressive when attacking the player in groups.\nGuards will find better locations to take cover.\nSoldiers will no longer call their PMC commander for backup while actively in combat with the player.\nHeavy guards now break holdup after 4 seconds and attempt to attack the player.\nThe enemy AI has 22 states that they switch between. All have been incrementally refined for a better stealth/action experience.\nGuards will now be better about finding “safe areas” to call in backup and manhunts.\nFixed an issue where guards do not return to their original patrol if they've been stunned and woken up.\nRefined Guard “Investigate” state. Guards spend more time investigating a sight/sound stimulus and will investigate a larger area\nFixed an issue where guards would “pop back” a short distance away from the player when entering their alarmed state.\nAdjust A.I. behavior when they are shot at, but do not know where the player is.\nGuards are now able to reload and strafe simultaneously.\nFixed an issue where Soldiers die automatically when tripping on various objects throughout the game.\nFixed certain instances of collisionless, frozen guards.\nOn Quest, fixed an issue where guards would not ragdoll when killed while using Espire Vision.\n\n\nUX and UI Improvements\n\n\nThe Virtual Challenge Category Selection menu now displays the amount of available challenges and completion progress for each category.\nAdjusted the wording around “VR Operative” and “Espire Agent” difficulty selection to better note that they are difficulty modifiers.\nThe player will now be asked what difficulty they want to play when starting a new campaign.\nPlayers may now choose to play a mission on VR Operative (Hard) Mode without first playing the previous mission on VR Operative mode. Previously, you had to play each mission in-order on the hard difficulty.\nAdded a “Controllers” Setting Menu item to display the controller mapping of the player’s current VR Headset.\nPlaystyle badges must now be earned while playing a mission in one sitting.\nAfter completing a required challenge during the flashback segments, players will be shown a “challenges remaining” screen before the challenge score screen. This will let the player know how many more challenges they need to complete to advance the campaign.\nA distinct sound will now play whenever the repair tool is out of charge.\nThere is now a small tutorial hologram for using Hand Cameras, zooming them in, picking them up and then throwing them.
