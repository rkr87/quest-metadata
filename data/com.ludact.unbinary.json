Wear the yellow mask to be strong and able to carry large crates, climb walls and bridges by hanging from your hands, or switch to the green mask if you want to gain privileges and fire lasers at hidden targets to unlock doors, or even, hack the AI system with the purple mask and change the rules of the game, but beware, your job is to make sure this AI is ready to rule the planet and not screw it up.\n\nUNBINARY is an excellent game for anyone just starting out in virtual reality or looking to impress someone with its 100% hand-painted cartoon-style graphics.\n\n3 MASKS THAT OFFER DIFFERENT ABILITIES\n\n22 DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN A DEEP STORY\n\n100% HAND-PAINTED IN VIRTUAL REALITY",
