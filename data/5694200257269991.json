        "description": "DEMO CONTAINS 15 FREE LEVELS\n\nVrickey is a VR vertical shooter with a twist‚Äîyou use your body to guide the spaceship through the maze while clearing the path with twin guns.\n\nMake sure you keep away from the falling deadly balls, survive the trippy magic potions and dodge the cannonballs, relentlessly aiming for your head. The journey won't be easy, this challenging arcade will put your focus to the ultimate test!\n\nThe game can be as large as you wish‚Äîit adapts to any room size. It works best with a rectangular play space that allows more movement in less space, as it uses one dimension for moving. A large Guardian can turn the game into a fun fitness experience!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Campaign: 5 stages x 10 levels = 50 levels in total (the first 15 levels in the demo)\n- Arcade: Infinite survival in normal, hard and turbo modes\n- 4 different weapons\n- Using movement and body gestures to control the ship (see below)\n- The game scales to fit the play space; increase the boundary size for a larger and more difficult game\n- 3 different achievements per level\n- An optional, distraction free ‚ÄúZen‚Äù environment\n\nGESTURES\n\n- Raise your hands to speed up\n- Crouch to slow down\n- Lean back for backward flip\n- Jump to activate a special weapon",

                "change_log": "Sync with Arcade update (v1.2.0)\n\n- Many new features - see the full release notes for the full game infinite arcade update below\n- 7 free levels\n- The previews now available for all the campaign levels\n\n---\n\nVrickey Arcade Update (v1.2.0)\n\nThis is a big update covering many different aspects of the game.\n\n## ARCADE MODE\nA new arcade mode features an infinite survival maze in which the goal is to stay alive as long as possible. There are two levels of difficulty and a special 'turbo' arcade mode that is much faster than a regular game. The turbo sections show up occasionally in 'normal' and 'hard' modes as well.\n\n## CAMPAIGN LEVELS\nThe campaign levels are redesigned and include many new features. Now there are 40 levels in total organized in 4 stages.\n\n## MORE DYNAMIC GAMEPLAY\nThe game core is improved and the gameplay is faster, more dynamic and better balanced.\n\n## NEW PRECISION-GUIDED GUN\nAs an alternative to the existing gun, we added a new, 'precise' gun with a laser target. Compared to the standard gun, the bullets are smaller and hit the target virtually instantaneously. The gun takes 2.5 more ammo energy than the standard gun shot. Another feature of this gun is that it can pass through the wire barrier, which comes with an extra ammo price. Hold the A or X button to change the weapon.\n\n## NEW MAZE FEATURES\n- There are many new elements in the maze that improve the action side of the game, like rocks, spikes, turbo mode, large rotating wheels, bigger deadly balls.\n- On the other side, interactive elements are added that change behavior when you shoot at them, like rotating elements and switches.\n- Finally, there are two new types of the potions: a purple potion that spins the maze around and a blue potion that shrinks the spaceship size\n- Now there are 5 lives (in both campaign and arcade modes), every 50 broken glass blocks get you a new life.\n\n## NEW GESTURES\nTwo new body gestures are added:\n- Before, lifting the hands above the head would increase the spaceship speed, rotate it 45 degrees and fill the ammo a little. We added another variant of the same gesture that is triggered when the player raises their hands higher above the head. This will increase the speed and add even more ammo, and rotate the ship 90 degrees (the same as with crouching).  \n- Leaning backwards will cause the spaceship to also flip backwards and move away from the maze for a moment. This gesture can be useful when trying to avoid falling balls.\n\n## IMPROVED PERFORMANCE\nThe game now runs at 80FPS (before it was 72FPS), while the simplified environment called 'Zen' runs at 90FPS (from 80FPS).\n\nWe hope that the result of this update is a better shooter / puzzle balance and overall more interesting and fun gaming experience. Your feedback is appreciated as always."
