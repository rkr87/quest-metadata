(v2.3.2)\n🐜 Fixes a super rare and nasty bug (5 players affected in the last 6 months) where the save file would be corrupted when saving (e.g. dead battery when saving), recovering it from the leaderboards entries if necessary. Previously, an affected player had to email us, then sideload the recovered save file: now, it is recovered in-game if needed (internet connection required for the recovery). And it shouldn't happen anymore anyway, as save files are also backed up locally, prior to being overwritten. No more super rare and nasty bug! Yay!"
