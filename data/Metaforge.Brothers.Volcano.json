        "description": "üåã Brothers Volcano is a social VR experience for all standalone Meta Quest headsets, that allows groups of users to freely explore around a vast 20km¬≤ underwater landscape, while learning about geology, geophysics and oceanography.\n\nüó∫Ô∏è The 3D ocean terrain is based on real high-resolution scans of Brothers Volcano, offering easy hiking trails, many informative boards & slideshows along the way, and several scenic spots to read related scientific journals.\n\nüèóÔ∏è Uniquely visualizing the volcano's depth below sea level required building the tallest known tower for the Metaverse, a Dark Tower inspired fortress, reaching 1.3km / 0.86mi high. To get inside, follow the educational hiking trails to finds the hidden keys üóùÔ∏è\n\nüë• Additionally, the multiplayer experience supports synced lecture slides, laser pointers & Superman flying abilities, so anyone can join the marine adventure and zoom around as a fellow tuna fish üêü\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nüîÉ Includes an optional demo mode setting, which intelligently helps reset the experience when shared within a group or public venue.\n\nüó£Ô∏è For remote voice or text chat, Meta's built-in social features are currently required.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note : This app is designed to run stably at render scale 2. However, to ensure maximum framerate performance we generally recommend having only one guardian (by clearing any duplicate guardian history), then restarting device before launching.",
