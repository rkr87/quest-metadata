        "description": "Gravity Sketch is the immersive 3D design tool that empowers you to create, share and collaborate on your best design ideas. Go beyond the bounds of 2D sketching to express yourself in a virtual studio and explore iterations of designs. Communicate design intent with greater clarity, and invite others to help shape your ideas and decision-making.\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntuitive 3D expression: Express your ideas at 1:1 scale in a virtual studio, just as you imagined them. Gestural actions and simple tools open up infinite possibilities.\n\nRefinement tooling: Take sketches further with surfacing and sculpting tools. Adjust shapes, proportions, textures, and lighting to capture the right details you need to communicate your idea.\n\nCollaboration: Invite colleagues, friends, or clients to join your virtual space in-headset or on screen to work together in real-time. Make faster decisions together on design direction, reducing your product’s time to market by 70+%.\n\nOrganization and storage: Access an extensive library of ready-to-use 3D assets, including models, materials, and environments. Import and export your own creations, incorporate them into workflows effortlessly via LandingPad.\n\nCommunity: Join a passionate community of designers. Explore comprehensive tutorials, learn from experts, and get inspired by others’ Gravity Sketch projects.\n\nHelp email: support@gravitysketch.com \nGeneral inquiries: hello@gravitysketch.com\nTo unlock our enterprise capabilities please contact us",
