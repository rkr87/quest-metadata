        "description": "Gravity Sketch is the immersive 3D design tool that empowers you to create, share and collaborate on your best design ideas. Go beyond the bounds of 2D sketching to express yourself in a virtual studio and explore iterations of designs. Communicate design intent with greater clarity, and invite others to help shape your ideas and decision-making.\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntuitive 3D expression: Express your ideas at 1:1 scale in a virtual studio, just as you imagined them. Gestural actions and simple tools open up infinite possibilities.\n\nRefinement tooling: Take sketches further with surfacing and sculpting tools. Adjust shapes, proportions, textures, and lighting to capture the right details you need to communicate your idea.\n\nCollaboration: Invite colleagues, friends, or clients to join your virtual space in-headset or on screen to work together in real-time. Make faster decisions together on design direction, reducing your product‚Äôs time to market by 70+%.\n\nOrganization and storage: Access an extensive library of ready-to-use 3D assets, including models, materials, and environments. Import and export your own creations, incorporate them into workflows effortlessly via LandingPad.\n\nCommunity: Join a passionate community of designers. Explore comprehensive tutorials, learn from experts, and get inspired by others‚Äô Gravity Sketch projects.\n\nHelp email: support@gravitysketch.com \nGeneral inquiries: hello@gravitysketch.com\nTo unlock our enterprise capabilities please contact us",

measurement value of an import in the import menu without it becoming inaccurate.\n- The thicken/offset measurement value no longer renders in front of all geometry and UI.\n- Fixed some older reference image files rotating 90 degrees on export to FBX or GLB.\n- Can no longer use the subdivision merge tool on objects more than 10,000 polygons to bypass the 10,000 polygon subdivision conversion limit.\n- Fixed Quest 3 defaulting to Quest 1 controllers when launching via Steam Link.\n- Improved message when attempting to join a Collab room on an out of date version.\n- You can now

positioning of Quest controllers in SteamVR being slightly too high.\n- Fixed textures applying incorrectly to thickened surfaces.\n- Fixed a case where offsetting a subd object, extruding an edge then switching to thicken could cause an invalid surface.\n- Tapping on a text entry field twice in a row in the web browser no longer causes the blue button menu to become unopenable.\n- Fixed passthrough being visible through several materials that were meant to be opaque.\n- FBX files with transparency will now retain their transparency if imported back into Gravity sketch.\n- Fixed ghost previews of NURBS surfaces remaining present when hitting the undo button when creating a surface with point mode.\n- Grabbing and duplicating every point on a subdivision object no longer leaves ghost points for the duration of your grab.\n- HDR reflections are now applied to measurement objects.\n- Fixed an issue where another user in Collab baking mirror on more than one object at once would cause all but one of the objects to become uninteractable to you.\n- Added missing Reset Weight option to the Volume edit menu.\n- Fixed period key on the sign-in keyboard within symbols section not being functional.\n- When performing an on-device export to cloud, the \"Please Stand By\" screen now properly dismisses before the upload to cloud is complete.\n- Fixed the level of detail slider

overlap with the UI.\n- Fixed text sometimes overflowing its bounds on the on-controller notification when saving or exporting to a longer directory.\n- Can now open template files via recents section in lobby.\n- Fixed tooltip on Collab rooms in lobby saying ‚ÄúClick to Open Sketch‚Äù.\n- Removed HDR reflections from Collab avatar preview in LandingPad Collab menu.\n- Moving an edge on a subdivision object while it is highlighted by a subd tool no longer causes the edge highlight to remain in its original place.\n- Moving font files from cloud to local no causes the app to think they‚Äôre sketch files.\n- Remove apostrophe from file name when exporting a free Collab room.\n- Fixed a case where some subdivision surfaces could fail to import.\n- Fixed certain FBX files failing to import.\n- Very large objects that are scaled down are no longer coloured completely black.\n- Thumbnails are now preserved for more file formats if moving them from cloud to local files.\n- View points in a sketch file are now imported properly regardless of the method used to import them.\n- Free Collab rooms now appear in recently accessed files/rooms list in lobby.\n- Dragging a single sketch object with a texture into the import menu no longer uploads/saves it as a reference image rather than a prefab.\n- Selection with the selection tool is no longer frequently accidentally cancelled when selecting locally mirrored objects if the controller is too near the gumball/gimbal UI.\n- The import menu now shows more than 100 files in a cloud folder.\n- Moving or scaling points with the non-drawing hand thumbstick while sliding edges or vertices no longer breaks the sliding constraints and repositions the grabbed points/edges to the position of the controller.\n- In Collab you now see other users‚Äô shadow and quality option toggles in their menus according to their hardware rather than your own.\n\nScreen Collab\n\nüöÄ Features & Tweaks\n\n- Added proxy network
