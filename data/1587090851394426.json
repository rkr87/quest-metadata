When you click the trigger and drag, everything within the box will be added to the selection. Hold the shift trigger while selecting to add to an existing selection.\n- Added a purple button menu to the selection tool with the following options:\n    - Selection Mode\n    - Bounding Box\n    - Show Gumball\n    - Select Groups\n    - Restrict to Mirror\n- You can now duplicate objects while moving them using the Selection tool gumball.\n- Added a new Section View tool. Drawing a box with this tool selected will cause everything within the box to become temporarily invisible, allowing you to take a section view of your sketch.\n- Reworked the new user First Sketch experience.\n- Improved speed of FBX imports, particularly files containing many individual objects.\n- Improved the export of subdivision objects to FBX when the \"control mesh\" option is selected. Notable changes are:\n    - Thickened objects export as a single mesh, whether they are baked or not.\n    - Fixed a bug where unbaked thickened surfaces would not open in Alias.\n    - Fixed a bug where subd surfaces with several disconnected components would not open in Alias.\n    - Fixed a bug where some vertices of thickened objects on the mirror would be duplicated.\n- Added a Round Corners toggle to the subdivision edit menu. When enabled the corners of open subdivision faces will be rounded as in previous versions; when disabled these corners will be sharp.\n- Changed the appearance of subdivision creases on boundary and boundary-adjacent edges to match industry standards.\n- Baked thickened/offset subdivision objects now look identical to their pre-baked counterparts.\n- Added a Mesh Quality export option for FBX and OBJ exports that determines the complexity of objects upon being exported as meshes.\n- Moved Export out of the Save menu into its own menu.\n- Added various export option presets for different target applications such as Blender, VRED and Alias.\n- The on-controller quick Export button will now immediately trigger an export with the last-selected export settings.\n- Moved Flip Normals tool to the main tool selector.\n- There is no longer a restriction on moving objects closer to or further away from the mirror while exporting . The functionality has now been moved to a Restrict to Mirror setting to the Selection tool menu.\n- Added ‚ÄúChoose a Preset‚Äù text to rigged chassis menu when a preset has not yet been chosen.\n\nüêõ Bug Fixes\n\n- You can now correctly see other users‚Äô graphical option UI toggles on their menus in Collab according to their hardware rather than yours.\n- Made the history clock on Vive wand controllers harder to trigger by accident.\n- Fixed subdivision geometry disappearing when disconnecting an edge from the mirror while holding the shift trigger.\n- Cleaned up the positioning of the ‚ÄòGumdrop Height‚Äô slider in the Environments menu.\n- Prevented notifications overlapping when taking an instant photo in a Collab room and simultaneously uploading it to the cloud.\n- Added the minus icon to the red button when grabbing layers.\n- Fixed scaling the screenshot menu and then taking an instant photo causing the screenshot to not scale by the same amount as the menu.\n- Fixed inverted normals on subdivision toruses.\n- Fixed selecting an environment preset in Collab that has an active custom HDR causing the HDR to be disabled.\n- You can now edit the measurement value of an import in the import menu without it becoming inaccurate.\n- The thicken/offset measurement value no longer renders in front of all geometry and UI.\n- Fixed some older reference image files rotating 90 degrees on export to FBX or GLB.\n- Can no longer use the subdivision merge tool on objects more than 10,000 polygons to bypass the 10,000 polygon subdivision conversion limit.\n- Fixed Quest 3 defaulting to Quest 1 controllers when launching via Steam Link.\n- Improved message when attempting to join a Collab room on an out of date version.\n- You can now interact with the edit panel when the subdivision Separate tool is selected.\n- Fixed viewpoint previews in the Viewpoints menu sometimes being inaccurate when jumping between viewpoints.\n- You can now successfully launch an out of date Windows launcher build from an elevated permissions directory without needing elevated permissions.\n- Fixed the order of the three most recent files in the lobby being incorrect if one of them was a local file.\n- Merging a mirrored subdivision objects into a NURBS objects that sits across the mirror will no longer leave orphaned vertices.\n- Fixed positioning of Quest controllers in SteamVR being slightly too high.\n- Fixed textures applying incorrectly to thickened surfaces.\n- Fixed a case where offsetting a subd object, extruding an edge then switching to thicken could cause an invalid surface.\n- Tapping on a text entry field twice in a row in the web browser no longer causes the blue button menu to become unopenable.\n- Fixed passthrough being visible through several materials that were meant to be opaque.\n- FBX files with transparency will now retain their transparency if imported back into Gravity sketch.\n- Fixed ghost previews of NURBS surfaces remaining present when hitting the undo button when creating a surface with point mode.\n- Grabbing and duplicating every point on a subdivision object no longer leaves ghost points for the duration of your grab.\n- HDR reflections are now applied to measurement objects.\n- Fixed an issue where another user in Collab baking mirror on more than one object at once would cause all but one of the objects to become uninteractable to you.\n- Added missing Reset Weight option to the Volume edit menu.\n- Fixed period key on the sign-in keyboard within symbols section not being functional.\n- When performing an on-device export to cloud, the \"Please Stand By\" screen now properly dismisses before the upload to cloud is complete.\n- Fixed the level of detail slider

menus when navigating file directories of guest teams.\n- The first time you change an option in the Workspace menu in a Collab room that has a custom HDR no longer give a false notification you are uploading an HDR.\n- The view point switching UI hint over the the thumbstick now disappears when entering edit mode.\n- Multiple levels of grouping are now preserved when importing a sketch file.\n- Fixed there being no visible edit tool selected immediately after converting an object to suvdivision.\n- Fixed a case where changing the font of existing text in the 3D Text tool preview could cause overlap with the UI.\n- Fixed text sometimes overflowing its bounds on the on-controller notification when saving or exporting to a longer directory.\n- Can now open template files via recents section in lobby.\n- Fixed tooltip on Collab rooms in lobby saying ‚ÄúClick to Open Sketch‚Äù.\n- Removed HDR reflections from Collab avatar preview in LandingPad Collab menu.\n- Moving an edge on a subdivision object while it is highlighted by a subd tool no longer causes the edge highlight to remain in its original place.\n- Moving font files from cloud to local no causes the app to think they‚Äôre sketch files.\n- Remove apostrophe from file name when exporting a free Collab room.\n- Fixed a case where some subdivision surfaces could fail to import.\n- Fixed certain FBX files failing to import.\n- Very large objects that are scaled down are no longer coloured completely black.\n- Thumbnails are now preserved for more file formats if moving them from cloud to local files.\n- View points in a sketch file are now imported properly regardless of the method used to import them.\n- Free Collab rooms now appear in recently accessed files/rooms list in lobby.\n- Dragging a single sketch object with a texture into the import menu no longer uploads/saves it as a reference image rather than a prefab.\n- Selection with the selection tool is no longer frequently accidentally cancelled when selecting locally mirrored objects if the controller is too near the gumball/gimbal UI.\n- The import menu now shows more than 100 files in a cloud folder.\n- Moving or scaling points with the non-drawing hand thumbstick while sliding edges or vertices no longer breaks the sliding constraints and repositions the grabbed points/edges to the position of the controller.\n- In Collab you now see other users‚Äô shadow and quality option toggles in their menus according to their hardware rather than your own.\n\nScreen Collab\n\nüöÄ Features & Tweaks\n\n- Added proxy network support for macOS.\n- Added various export option presets for different target applications such as Blender, VRED and Alias.\n\nüêõ Bug Fixes\n\n- Improved scaling of edit points when following a VR user.\n- Fixed being able to exit a view point by clicking and dragging the mouse with the eraser selected.\n- Fixed being sometimes able to draw and move the camera at the same time.\n- Annotations
