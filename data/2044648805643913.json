        "description": "The viewer joins Astra as she undertakes an experimental treatment that will allow her to enter her mother’s mind after she has been left in a coma following a terrible car accident. Her mother Eleanor is a renowned children’s author and illustrator. Astra’s presence makes Eleanor’s comatose mind spring to life transporting her to the magical world of her famous book series. As Astra explores treehouses in the sky, stunning ice fields, and enchanted forests, she learns the disturbing truth behind her mother’s accident. Lucid is a visually beautiful sci-fi drama, which deals with an emotional and difficult topic. The experience was built from the ground-up in VR, pushing forward cinematic storytelling techniques.",
