        "description": "\"Catch!!\", \"Hit!!\", \"Dodge!!\", \"Elbow!!\"\n\nHere you will find a variety of games that will train your reaction and coordination skills to the limit.\nAll games will increase or decrease in difficulty depending on success or failure.\nTherefore, the level of difficulty is automatically selected to match your level.\n\nCatching games improve hand-eye coordination skills.\nHitting games improve quick and accurate positioning skills.\nBall avoidance games mainly improve upper body avoidance skills.\nElbow strike games mainly improve motor function in the shoulder area.\nWall avoidance games improve the reactivity of the whole body, including footwork.\n\nCombining several of these games at the same time requires more complex and quicker situational decisions.\n\nFor advanced users, there is also the ability to create and save/load your own customized and unique training.\n\nYou can freely change the range, timing, and speed of the target, or even the size of your own hit points, to create a training program that suits you best!",
