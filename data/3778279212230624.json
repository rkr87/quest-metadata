        "description": "Debate about reproductive rights is often heated. But behind every family planning decision, there is a human story. The Choice is an award winning virtual reality experience that lets us see from a different perspective the emotional and complex nature behind one woman’s choice.\n\nMeet Kristen, a young Indigenous woman from Austin, TX, who dreams of raising a family but instead finds herself facing a dehumanizing system working against her survival. \n\nThe Choice blends techniques from traditional documentary storytelling, volumetric video capture, and animation to redefine not only how we tell these women’s stories but also the agency in which the audience experiences them and connects with the subject on a deep, emotional level.",
