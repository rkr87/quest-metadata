        "description": "Welcome aboard! Embark on a thrilling virtual reality expedition to French Polynesia with the University of Miami and the Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation (KSLOF). As a coral reef ecologist in training, you'll have the opportunity to explore the mesmerizing beauty of the South Pacific Ocean's three main coral reef types: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. In this immersive experience, you'll learn about the fascinating zonation patterns that define each reef type, from the depths where light intensity and temperature change, to the areas where waves and water chemistry shape the location of specific organisms. You'll be one step closer to becoming a coral reef expert by mastering the art of identifying reef zones and types. Join us for an unforgettable journey that combines education and adventure in one of the world's most stunning natural wonders.  \n\n \n\nThis app is part of the Coral Reef Ecology Curriculum developed by the KSLOF. To learn more about coral reefs, visit their Education Portal (www.lof.org/CoralReefCurriculum), which contains corresponding education materials that complement the Virtual Reef Expedition app.  ",
