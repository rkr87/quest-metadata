If you experience this, to clear the lock, you need to grab another item, such as a grenade or weapon in your other hand. We recommend you stick to the ammo vacuum effect to collect magazines in the meantime.\n- We are aware of a bug where manually reloading weapons can cause the second player in multiplayer to lose grip on a held item.\n\nThanks again for your incredible support through our first year on the Oculus store.
