Play multiplayer with users all over the world.\n- We’ve made animation set-up changes for improved performance.\n- Improved handling and VFX for the Grenade Launcher \n- Improved colliders for weapons and enemies.\n- Improved collision with player weapons.\n- Improve user experience: Empty magazines can no longer be picked up and instead disappear. \n- Improved user experience flow of Oculus Invites.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fixed broken spawn groups improve gameplay and performance.\n- Enemies are now less likely to lose track of the player and get stuck.\n- Fixed a bug that led to a dead-end on the result screen after multiple games in a row.\n- Fixed a bug where users lost holstered weapons after respawning.\n- Fixed a bug where the map selection would display the wrong icon.\n- Fixed a bug where the shop buttons became greyed out after initial use. It should now be clearer which weapons are available and which are not.\n- Fixed a bug that led to interruptions in the score screen of Last Bastion. \n- Fixed a bug that kept the user on a grey screen and required a restart.\n- Fixed bugs with the Multiplayer Menu UI.\n- Fixed an issue with the score on the results screen not awarding the User points for completing the game.\n- Fixed invisible projectiles from enemies on the RIFT version of the Game.\n- Fixed an issue where Autogun cultist bullets were using Bolter VFX on collision.\n- Fixed a bug in the Heart of Dread results screen where the User could see outside the map.\n\nKnown Issue:\n\n\n- We’re aware of an issue where attempting to grab a magazine dropped by another player in multiplayer may lock up the hand you are trying to grab with. If you experience this, to clear the lock, you need to grab another item, such as a grenade or weapon in your other hand. We recommend you stick to the ammo vacuum effect to collect magazines in the meantime.\n- We are aware of a bug where manually reloading weapons can cause the second player in multiplayer to lose grip on a held item.\n\nThanks again for your incredible support through our first year on the Oculus store. We hope you enjoy our latest update.\n\nConnect with other players and the team on our Discord community at Pixeltoys.com/community\n"
