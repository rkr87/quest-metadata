        "description": "'Realms of Flow' is all about calming down and drifting away into deep and soothing states of mind. It utilizes a combination of high-framerate stereoscopic 180°-video and interactive elements for breathing, mindful listening, playfulness, humming, and frequency entrainment.\n\nYou can choose from several experiences, each offering a different scenery, general atmosphere and meditative narration.\nIn the Session Timing options you can set the start time and duration for the different guide features: Voice-over, Breathing Guide, Spatial Sounds, Humming Guide, Frequency Entrainment, and Element of Play.\nEach feature has various settings that you can adjust according to your preferences. For example, the breathing tempo, which affects a customizable visual focus object, can be a fixed user-defined tempo or controlled using your hand or belly movement.\n\nThe focus of this application is less on giving a step-by-step voice guidance, but on creating small cinematic journeys with a poetic and meditative touch.\n\nRealms of Flow strives to offer unique immersive audio-visual atmospheres to provide thoughtful inspiration, evoke emotions, and create interesting, soothing, and meaningful states of mind that will hopefully enrich your palette of being. - Immerse yourself in the infinite Realms of Flow!",

                "change_log": "// Realms of Flow | 1.0.31 - 12.08.2024 //\t\n\t\n- Two new experiences: 'Nature's Calling' (regular CGI) and 'Altered States of Mycelia' (experimental AI)\t\n>> Tip: In 'Altered States of Mycelia' try playing with the peripheral instances of the visuals, setting them close to the center for some interesting effects.\n- The experimental experiences (using generative AI for the visuals) are now on Home menu page 4\t\n\n- Added ratio presets (for inhalalation vs. exhalation length) to simplify setting the tempo of the 'Auto' breath mode\t\n- Added an additional 'Simple Mode', which allows setting the 'Auto' tempo using a single slider instead of setting the individual breath phases (for tempo gradient and breath holds use the 'Advanced Mode')\t\n- When using 'Simple Mode', holding the controller button labeled 'Calibrate Breath Tempo' will now allow you to simply nudge the 'Auto' tempo up and down using the triggers. In the 'Advanced Mode' holding the same button will bring up the previously introduced tempo calibration using controller distance to act out the desired tempo incl. breath holds.\t\n- Added an option to visualize the breath hold phases (when set to 2s or longer) to have a better impression of the remaining hold time\n\n- Added a tour to the 'Session Timing Options' as intro for new users\t\n\t\n- Added German versions of the menu tooltips (when hovering options), instructions and help sections\t\n\n- Updated the voice-over of the 'Timeless Being' experience with a more empathic version \n\n- Fixed a bug with the main visuals' distance setting not working as intended, when loading previously saved settings with breath mode 'OFF'\n\t\n- Plenty of other small tweaks and fixes\t\n\n\n>> A little tip for alternative music on Quest (standalone): \nThe latest system software update now allows you to run other music apps (e.g. Spotify Premium in the Quest browser) parallel to other apps without audio degradation. \n\nAn example that I personally enjoy: \nRoF experience 'Home Within' combined with the track 'Sit Around the Fire' (Music: John Hopkins, Narration:Ram Dass) from Spotify.\n\nFor that, set the music and narration volume to 0 in the RoF Sound settings.\nFor some music tracks (which are not in C major scale) I'd recommend to also turn down the volume of other tonal elements (Breath Focus Obj. Noise, Breath Timing Sound, Spatial Sounds, Humming Reference Sound) to avoid disharmony.\n\n\n- Another hint (Quest standalone): For resetting the view, only use the RoF controller shortcut (B button), since using the Meta system button interchangeably with that will cause unwanted offsets, especially when using Meta's experimental lying down mode. (RoF has that functionality built in already)\n"

                "change_log": "// Realms of Flow | 1.0.29 - 26.05.2024 //\t\n\t\n- Added new experience \"Dissolve\"\t\n- The Hookah (last update's Easter egg) is now officially documented in the controls overview - hold right Trigger for 1s to enable / disable it\t\n- Added Hookah Wisdom: When you take a long puff on the Hookah (and the current experience's narration is not playing or about to start playing) you will hear some selected and hopefully inspiring life wisdom\t\n- Fixed some bugs with the Hookah: Haptics were not working with the left controller and sometimes a bright visual artifact would float mid-air\t\n- Added another hopefully relaxing item for you to play with: The Pan Drum - bring it up by pressing the left trigger for 1s (as documented)\t\n- Added a calibration option for the Auto breath tempo - you can use your controller distance to act out the desired Auto breath tempo, either before experience start (click the stopwatch icon for Time 1 and Time 2 in the Breath Settings sub menu) or during the experience (hold the left controller's upper face button for 1s - as documented in the controls overview)\t\n- Added the ability to set longer breath phases for the Auto breath tempo mode (up to 240s as requested by some users - for training of long breath holds)\t\n- Added slider to set the intensity of the haptic breath tempo indicator\t\n- Added new spatial sound type \"Books&Paper\"\t\n- Added new style \"Spiral\" for the main shape of the visual breath focus object\t\n- Added option to use gaze direction to steer the selection pointer, instead of a pointer attached to the controller (can be enabled in the Control Settings sub-menu)\t\n- Fixed: Some frequent crashes that a few users experienced (on Quest standalone) should not occur anymore\t\n- Foveated rendering (Quest standalone) is now adaptive - depending on the processing load, so it will only kick in when needed. Hence it is now also enabled by default on both Quest 2 + 3 and recommended to keep enabled.\t\n- Lots of other small tweaks and fixes"

                "change_log": "// Realms of Flow | 1.0.24  - 28.02.2024 //\n\n- New experience \"Home Within\"\n- Added two new breath tempo control modes:\n-> Head | Control the breath tempo with your natural head movement by slightly tilting your head up when inhaling and down when exhaling\n-> Sound | Create an audible airflow with your lips while you are exhaling, inhale quitely. Closed headphones and a quiet room are recommended. You may have to adjust the sensitivity in the settings menu to your specific microphone.\n- Auto breath tempo mode: Added the ability to define a gradual ramp for the breath tempo with start and end time, as well as to add holds, which can be set to change over time as well. The Auto tempo mode is now also the default mode when starting the app, to create a better experience for new users that skip the tutorial.\n- Improved responsitivity/accuracy of the Belly breath tempo control mode\n- Added sensitivity and speed controls for breath tempo modes Belly, Head and Sound \n- Added the ability to mix and match visuals, voice-over and music for even more customisability and replay value. To do so select the library icon next to \"Narration\" in the Session Timing options. This can only be done before an experience. You will hear audio previews while selecting options.\n- Adjusted the Element of Play mechanics so that it is easier to reach the maximum extent of the success-effects, especially when the duration is set relatively short in the Session Timing options. Moreover adjusted the width-extent of the Element of Play controller paths, so the goals are not as much on the periphery of the field of vision\n- The new breath control modes Head and Sound work a little bit differently with the Element of Play's controller element, since you are creating the paths and timing of the goals on the fly which makes for an interesting (potentially flow-inducing) challenge. Whereas with the control modes Auto and Controller these paths are still created according to the tempo defined in the Breath Guide settings.\n- Updated UI design\n- 🐰Added an easter egg that some of you might be familiar with from Deep States. This also introduces a new temporary breath mode when activated. Hint: You might need a second to Trigger it. 🤓\n- Added style options for the center particle of the visual breath focus object\n- Added sound type options for the Humming Guide reference Omm-sound, some subtle variety to the default Omm-Mix sound, as well as a new style for the Humming visuals.\n- Added two new Spatial Sound type categories \n- Improved settings menu alignment when resetting the view with Optimized Reclining enabled\n- Improved file handling when using a second headset account with App Sharing enabled on Meta Quest standalone - previously only experiences from the first page worked, while the other experiences created a frozen image. Now all experiences are accessible with the second account. However, when using a third, forth etc. account there will be a lock-symbol to indicate that the content has not been found (to avoid freezes).\n- Lots of other small tweaks, fixes and improvements"

Which half is mirrorred depends on the \"Flip\" setting.\nThis gives some very interesting effects in some experiences e.g. the sky being above and beneath you in \"Timeless Being\".\n- The main visuals can now be set closer than before and will also automatically be closer than before with higher \"Extra Depth\" values. The recommended defaults for \"Distance\" and \"Extra Depth\" are marked on the sliders with green dots while using the right thumbstick control.\n- Added \"Extended Out-Breath\" option for the \"Auto\" breath tempo mode, which makes the out-breath phase twice as long as the in-breath phase. This is very effective in lowering heart rate and increasing heart rate variability (HRV). If coupled with an Auto Tempo of ~10s (= 6 breaths per minute) you are using a calm-inducing breathing technique called \"Resonance Breathing\".\nIf you are interested in the science you can read more about it e.g. here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8924557/\n- Added \"Follow View\" option, which makes the scene follow your head's rotation with a smooth lag. Useful e.g. of you are lying in bed and want to able to turn around without having to reset the view manually. \n- Added \"Opacity\" slider for the humming visuals\n- Improved comfort with the \"Circular\" humming visual style by slowing down it's expansion at the periphery \n- Improved adaption of the humming rumble effect to different scene-depth/distance settings\n- Improved alignment of the triangular breath focus object to the scene with the \"Reset includes Roll Axis\" option enabled (now called \"Optimised Reset for Reclining\") \n- Improvements to the spatial sound visuals \n- Improved the transition out of an experience when \"Open-End\" is disabled. There is now a 30 sec. cool down, where music, environment sounds and visuals will fade away one after another, before re-entering the Home menu.\n- Fixed an issue with spatial sounds occasionally disappearing abruptly \n- Fixed an issue with the spatial sound visuals not featuring all available types when set to \"Mix\"\n- Added a short sound preview in the menu when selecting any menu option that is related to choosing a sound type\n- Improved initial appearance/timing of the visual breath focus object\n- Fixed an occasional black intersection artifact for the main visuals with high settings of \"Distance\" and \"Extra Depth\" combined\n- Fixed: Tutorial was not working correctly if user previously changed and saved certain settings (e.g. disabled voice-over)\n- Improved visibility of the Tutorial button if not yet completed \n- Fixed a bug where the volume slider for the voice-over would not work correctly when the volume was previously set to 0 by disabling voice in the Session Timing options\n- Fixed particle effects randomly appearing (popping in/out) when starting a further experience\n- Fixed (hopefully) occasional white flickering artifacts (strange bug on Quest with some system versions)\n- Removed \"Resume\" option in the Home menu, since it caused too many issues down the line and was not very useful. On Oculus headsets you can still automatically pause and resume an experience anytime by removing the headset and putting back on or by opening/closing the system menu overlay.\n- various other tweaks and fixes"
