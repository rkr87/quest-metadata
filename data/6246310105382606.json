        "description": "Undead Quest is a fun single player arcade game where with help of a bat, ball and a few spells, youâ€™ll fight against hordes of funny undead creatures. Hit the ball, cast spells, and move from one beautiful location to another to learn the secret of the undead.\n\nYou play as a student on a magical university cricket team in a fantasy world. After your team's victory in the tournament semi-finals and a rowdy night of celebration, you wake up in the forest. Barely having opened your eyes, you see a crowd of the undead heading straight for you. A crazy situation even for a fantasy world, frankly.\n\nCan you beat the challenges to find out why the undead are here and how to get rid of them? Prepare your hands, feet, and mind - Undead Quest is waiting for you.\n\nWhat does the demo version of the game include:\n- 7 first levels of the game with great graphics, \n- 7 enemy characters with their own funny traits,\n- 2 magic spells that will help you in the battles,\n- several cut-scenes revealing the general plot of the game,\n\nDownload, play and share your feedback with us to make one of the best arcade game in VR.",
