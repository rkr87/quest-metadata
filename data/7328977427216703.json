        "description": "From a small team of eight plus a dog named Mal, introducing Mother Bunker VR! \n\nKill zombies in VR! What else needs to be said? Step into Mother Bunker VR, where the apocalypse is a playground of endless possibilities and dangers. In this immersive VR experience, you're not just surviving; you're the architect of your destiny in a world teeming with zombies and eccentric characters.\n\n{835797458756469}\n\nBuild Your Bunker:\nSurvival starts with a well-stocked bunker. Transform your hideout into a fortress. Scavenge resources from the environment (and zombies) to upgrade your bunker. All upgrades are persistent! Customize it to reflect your style and strategy.\n\n{1045441910293201}\n\nFight the Undead:\nEngage in dynamic combat with melee tools and high-tech firearms. The low-poly aesthetic adds unique charm to intense zombie battles. Manage your weapons carefully—there’s no unlimited ammo, and your axe will lose durability after use.\n\nCraft and Survive:\nCraft food, bandages, and essentials to fight the undead. Every resource and item crafted is a step towards survival.\n\n{892921072709110}\n\nWhy Mother Bunker VR?\n-Immersive VR Experience: Unique low-poly aesthetic.\n-Dynamic Combat: Intense battles with varied zombies.\n-Creative Building: Upgrade and customize your bunker.\n\nReady to take on the apocalypse? In Mother Bunker VR, every decision matters and every encounter is a new adventure.\n\n\n{1051832139859899}\n{835731388360389}\n{1088261165993769}\n{1888076115019415}\n{3488527961456954}\n{1537977286925108}\n{1480307775995741}",
