        "description": "Art like never before. The Kremer Museum is an innovative new museum concept that combines the newest VR technology with world-class Old Master paintings. The museum includes pieces by Rembrandt, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals and many more Old Masters from the Dutch Golden Age.\n\nWalk around a fantastic new space, where the balance between traditional museums and VR is represented through a new sort of architecture. Be sure to check out Rembrandt’s “old man with a turban”, walk through it, and see the original back of the panel, to explore the work’s unique stamps of provenance.\n\nDesigned by architect Johan van Lierop, Founder of Architales and developed by MOYOSA MEDIA from the Netherlands, the museum features 74 Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings from the Dutch Golden Age, and is  accessible exclusively through VR.",
