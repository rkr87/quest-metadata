        "description": " **WELCOME TO PADEL VR EARLY ACCESS!**\n- PadelVR is a realistic padel simulation game, allowing you to practice and enjoy this wonderful sport anytime, anywhere.\n- What is padel? Padel is one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, combining elements from several racket sports. \n \nEARLY ACCESS: We're still in development, so some features are missing, and our dedicated physics engine is still being improved. Despite this, we are proud of our realistic performance, even though some aspects need refinement.\n \nNOTE: We've created a specific PADEL RACKET ADAPTER for the Quest controller, making the experience 100% more realistic! \n \n- Early access means you're paying a reduced price for the game. All updates during development will be included. We appreciate your feedback to make this the perfect padel game.\n \n- WHAT'S MISSING? The match option isn't available yet. We expect to have the AI match option ready by the end of September. The multiplayer mode will be available before the final release. The physics engine still needs some tweaking.\n \n- WHAT'S INCLUDED? Amazing indoor and outdoor stadiums, warm-up mode, and a fantastic set of challenges that let you work on:\n Dropshots, bandejas, volleys, rulo reja, smashes, serves, serve returns, double wall defense, lobs, chiquitas, and combinations of shots.
