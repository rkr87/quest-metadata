        "description": "\"Before the time of the giants, we lived freely under the Sun and Moon. Centuries have passed, but those stories of the surface world have been passed down through the generations. Now the giants are gone, and you, Vanguard, must venture out into the wilds once more. Be brave, and do not falter…\"\n\nFrom the world of Smalland: Survive the Wilds, immerse yourself into a new epic single-player adventure played at a tiny scale. After centuries living underground, the Smallfolk emerge from their burrows to reclaim the Overland now that the giants have gone. Explore, scavenge, craft and build as you fight to gain a foothold in this hostile new world.\n\nBUILD\nScavenge or refine resources to construct encampments with multiple material tiers, from wood to stone. Build your own permanent structure safely at the top of your very own Great Tree.\n\nCRAFT\nPick up your builder’s hammer at the workbench and craft the weapons, various armor sets and tools that’ll aid your survival in this vast, dangerous world. \n\nNATURE\nExperience a world of giant insects and towering arachnids. Some take kindly to strange beings in their homes, others do not. Tame and customize creatures to join your stables, and take arms against enemies - this world and its inhabitants are yours to conquer.\n\nEXPLORE\nAdventure through a land forgotten by time, with ancient relics from a long-forgotten era. Traverse stone sewers, sandy beaches, winding tunnels and dense caverns as you explore the land of the giants.",
