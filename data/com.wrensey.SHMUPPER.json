SHMUPPER is a dog-based arcade-style 3D SHMUP or “Shoot-em-up” that does just that! It tasks the player with the objective of battling waves of enemies through unique levels across the galaxy. It draws inspiration from classics in the genre such as Star Fox, Metal Slug, and Macross with a VR twist. \n\nWhile inspired by the iconic titles mentioned previously, this game comes with a twist. While in VR, the movement of your ship is done primarily through the movement of your body! In order to steer, the player must lean or step forwards, backward, left, or right in order to maneuver through space. ",
