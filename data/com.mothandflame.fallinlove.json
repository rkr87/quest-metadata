Inspired by “The 36 Questions that Lead to Love,” the goal of Fall In Love is to foster authentic human conversation in VR and to inspire people to feel an emotional connection with others. People will put on a headset and be transported to a whimsical forest where they come face to face with a group of actors, who they can then have a conversation with through voice recognition software.",
