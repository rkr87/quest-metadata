        "description": "Fly through the city streets as you gather rings, power ups, and try to top the leaderboards.\n\nRing Racer adds new fast paced gameplay to the VZfit experience.  Using our new active motion controls, steer a hoverboard through city streets. Avoid obstacles while hitting speed boosts, ramps, and rings. Each of the 9 cities available on release has a series of races and a banner to unlock.\n\nRing Racer plays like no other game out there so grab your board and get racing.\n\nActive Motion Controls\nLean your body to steer your board. It’s easy to learn but takes skill to master.\n\nController-Free Mode\n\nPut those controllers down and use your hands to grab rings and navigate through a fully supported controller free experience.\nNew User Interface and Home Space\n\nWe revamped all of VZfit. The home space is now a beautiful place to display banners and spend time. The map is now core to the navigation and you can see where races, challenges, and even other players are riding.\n\nMixed Reality\nCombine your world with ours and enable the mixed reality windows. These can be toggled on and off on the fly. The best part, they work in all VZfit modes!\n\nSo Much More\nWith challenges, PinPoint!, custom rides, streaming music, and virtual trainers, Ring Racer is just the start of everything VZfit has to offer. Race, Cycle, or even Walk, there’s a way for everyone to play.",
