        "description": "The Roman Forum was the civic center of ancient Rome and the single most admired quarter of the Eternal City. Here were located the Senate House, law courts, important temples, and historic monuments. Today, the Forum is in ruins, and even those able to visit have a difficult time understanding it. This app offers you the chance to take an interactive, self-guided tour of over 30 features in the Forum, which have been digitally reconstructed by archaeologists to show you how they appeared in the year AD 320. At many stops, you can fade between the Forum as it appears today and the way it looked in antiquity. As you take your visit, you may listen to commentary about what you are seeing given by distinguished experts. When you are finished with your tour, go to our website (www.romereborn.org), register, and gauge your level of expertise. Earn medals for your achievements and share them on social media. Now, youâ€™re ready to go on your next adventure in the ancient city!",
