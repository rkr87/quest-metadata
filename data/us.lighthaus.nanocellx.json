        "description": "Nano is a thrilling cellular adventure with real science in its DNA.  \n\nA strange virus is sweeping across the globe. As a trainee in a top-secret bioresearch program, you use your headset and haptic gloves to remotely control a nanodrone -- a tiny machine that gets injected into the human body. \n\nWith the drone, you operate a synthetic immune cell, jacking into infected patients around the world to fight their infections on the microscopic level, and ultimately track down and face the mystery virus itself. \n\nYou'll need to master the cell's living systems: you generate energy from food molecules, use the cell's DNA to manufacture a variety of proteins to keep the cell alive, and to combat invaders. This is not a science textbook -- it's a game to its core, but one that's based on real science.  You've never experienced biology, or gaming, like this.",
