Transform any indoor space into an incredible VR arena as you play a manic game of hide and seek with blasters. You’ll need to find a large open space, so start scouting for empty halls, tennis courts, and basketball courts!\n\nVERSUS is an all-new multiplayer version of Space Pirate Trainer. Every time you shoot a droid, another one will appear targeting your opponent, ending in all-out blaster chaos! \n",
