        "description": "I am pleased to present you the opportunity to integrate the \"Physics Laboratory\" app into school education.\nAs a physics teacher with a passion for educational innovation, I developed this app with the goal of enriching student learning through the use of virtual reality.\n\"Physics Laboratory\" is a virtual reality-based application designed to work with the Meta Quest 2 headset.\nIt offers students an immersive learning experience through simulations and virtual experiments.\nThe app aims to make physical concepts more accessible and tangible, encouraging interactivity and experimentation in a virtual environment.\nEducational Benefits: The app offers several educational benefits, including:\nPractical approach to physics concepts through virtual experiments.\nGreater student involvement and motivation in learning.\nAccess to complex contexts that would otherwise be difficult to replicate in a traditional classroom setting.\nThe app is constantly improving, I'm working on new rooms (new Physics experiments).\nI had my students try this app, it was a great success.\nLanguages: Italian and English.\nThis is a DEMO app.\ncontacts:\nnicoletmassi@gmail.com\nSome videos:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a9sbj2HDJj8roQFYGmpIDwGGoLZF0hEo",
