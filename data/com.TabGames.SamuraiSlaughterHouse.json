        "description": "Samurai Slaughter House is a story-driven action adventure game with physics based combat and lite RPG features.\n\nThere will be much much more added to the game but here are a few of the features currently in the game\n\n - Explore a stunning stylized world created by award winning VR developer and artist, Justin \"Tab\" Rosete.\n\n - Physics based combat that allows you to block/counter enemy attacks. Enemies will also attempt to predict and block player attacks\n\n - A large range of weapons, including a katana with a working sheath and throwing weapons.\n\n - Interact with and recruit NPCs to help you fight.\n\n - Collect friendly yokai monsters to help you in battle\n\n - Search randomly  spawned chests for money, weapons, equipment, and other items\n\n - Use your money and ingredients to purchase items from shops\n\n - Unlock and decorate player homes.\n\n- Meet interesting NPCs and complete quests for them to advance the story and unlock new areas and quests.\n\n - Fishing (probably different than what you're expecting but a lot of fun)\n\n - Intense volumetric blood effects (can be turned off in settings)\n\n - Two original soundtracks, drum 'n' bass and Lo-fi (player may chose if they wish to hear tracks from one or both albums)",
