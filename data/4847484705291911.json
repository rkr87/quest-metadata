Thank you for all of the feedback as well. \n\nThe last update we fixed the economy system to make it easier to earn money. We also added several new settings like Strafe, Smooth Rotation Speed, and Walk Speed. In this update we tried to focus on some of the bugs that some of you were encountering.\n\nFIXES:\n\n-Fixed the garden/farming bug that caused some plants to quit growing fruits or vegetables.\n\n-Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the mushroom vendor panel to not show up.\n\n-Increased texture memory to prevent the occasional blurry texture.\n\n-Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause inventory items to not auto retrieve and would be lost forever.\n\n-Added a setting to change Auto Retrieve Settings for tools. Currently if you were to leave a tool like a flashlight on the ground it would auto retrieve to your inventory after 10 seconds or when leaving a map. There are now settings under Controls to change the amount of time before this happens or to completely disable it.\n\n-Fixed LOD issues on some of the tree groups purchased for your homestead.\n\n-Disabled audio playing on level transitions. There was a crash issue related to audio playing during level transitions. Disabling audio playing there should fix this crash.\n\n-Updated German translation.\n\n-Fixed collision issue on the cabin in Cabin in the Woods that would prevent you from using free motion locomotion to walk through the door\n\n-We changed the default rotation for new users to Snap Rotation. A lot of new users didn’t know you could change the rotation settings and the default smooth rotation settings were making a lot of new users get motion sickness. This will not change anyone’s current settings. This will only be the new default settings for new players of the game.\n\n-Other misc fixes\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy the update!
