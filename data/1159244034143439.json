        "description": "Vendetta Online is a cross-platform 3D space combat MMORPG, allowing thousands of players to interact as the pilots of spaceships in a vast universe. Users may build their characters in any direction they desire, becoming rich captains of industry, military heroes, or outlaws. A fast-paced, realtime \"twitch\" style combat model gives intense action, coupled with the backdrop of RPG gameplay in a massive online galaxy. Three major player factions form a delicate balance of power, with several NPC sub-factions creating situations of economic struggle, political intrigue and conflict. The completely persistent universe and detailed storyline add to the depth of immersion, resulting in a unique online experience.\n\n- Integrated voice chat, Speech Recognition, gamepad support.\n- Vendetta Online for GearVR is Free To Play, with optional purchases to accelerate or unlock certain benefits. There is a level cap for Free users, but it usually takes weeks to reach. We plan to remove the level cap.",
