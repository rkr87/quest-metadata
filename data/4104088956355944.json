Big gravity zones are currently hard to see, I plan to improve that in the future.\n- Fixed objects moving a little when cloning them.\n- Flinging off other players should now give more reliable speeds.\n- Fixed flying glitches involving multiple players holding on to each other.\n- Maybe fixed an issue that would allow to beat and verify levels with a very short amount of time, without actually beating them.\n- Fixed an issue with hands flickering on Quest 3.\n- Fixed a bunch of common crashes."
