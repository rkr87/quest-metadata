        "description": "Apple Climbers (previously named Apple Runners), is a HBL (Hand Based Locomotion) game featuring the wonderful fruit, apples! I'm sure you probably already know this, but in order to move, you must use your hands, that's right, no moving around with the stick.\n\nHere, you can play a series of gamemodes including Freerun, Dungeon, and more! Or, equip some snazzy cosmetics to personalize your character!\n\nThe \"Main Map\", features many things to do! You can mess around with other Apples, go into the Closet (aka. Shop), or visit Mt. Ice!\n\n\"Grapple\", features a prototype-like land, where you can swing around and discover an, interesting secret...\n\n\"Freerun\" is a speedrun-like gamemode, where you start from the bottom, and run to the top!\n\n\"Dungeon\" is a creepy, dark, and scary place. And in there, you REDACTED\n\nExpect more modes to come! And have fun!\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n==========\nThis product is not affiliated with Gorilla Tag or Another Axiom LLC and is not endorsed or otherwise sponsored by Another Axiom LLC.
