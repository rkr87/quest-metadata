Compete cross-platform on many different challenges, such as hand-to-hand combat, tatami mat, and archery. Will you try to crack the top 100 leaderboard? \n\nMore on Swordsman: \n\nSwordsman is a physics-based medieval combat game designed for virtual reality. \n\nThe game features Knights, Vikings, Mongols, Samurai, Pirates, realistic armor physics, epic boss fights and powerful boss weapons, a Kraken, RPG player progression and customization, a Blacksmith, Armorer and Skill Master to help you build a character suited to your playstyle and lots of items to buy and unlock, all in effort to stop the Jötunn from taking over the world. \n\nThe Jötunn has recruited captains from all over the world, giving them godly weapons with which to command powerful armies. He wields seemingly infinite power: Hellfire.\n\nSwordsman also features gameplay modifiers. These will let you change how the core game works in fun and interesting ways. Hardcore enemies, invisible enemies (floating swords), Doomfist (super strength), the ability to slow time down whenever you want and many more.",
