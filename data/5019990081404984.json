        "description": "This type of training is often difficult to get access to, because it often requires an expert instructor, CPR Training Equipment (doll, AED, hygiene material, etc.), and a lot of time. \n\nCPR Simulator makes CPR training widely available in a simple, intuitive, and customisable way. \n\nAlmost every person needs to go through CPR training one or two times in their life, and many professionals are required to go through it every year or every second year.\n\nAATE VR has partnered up with First-8, who's a renowned company, selling first aid courses and material to both consumers and big companies.\n\nMore environments/scenarios will be added, types of citizens to resuscitate, variations of AED models will be incorporated, and NPCâ€™s will be added after release.\n\nThis application is the 'CPR Simulator - Personal Edition', and is only meant for personal use.
