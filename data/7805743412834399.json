        "description": "A VR tower defense experience where you function as both general and soldier. As the newly appointed Sky Marshall you oversee the defense effort and take on the enemy with bow, zeppelin, and battle orbs! \n\nSTRATEGY AND ACTION\nAs the sole defender of the realm, you will need to be an effective archer as well as a fast-thinking strategist. The enemy is persistent and strong, and will often attack more than one front. Your ability to keep calm, build the right towers on the right spots, freezing a group of enemies with your battle orbs while nailing head-shots with your bow, will be crucial to your success\n\nADAPT AND PREVAIL\nThroughout your missions, you will confront gradually tougher enemies with various skill sets and stats. No single strategy works for them all. You will have to adapt and experiment with alternative tactics to succeed.",
