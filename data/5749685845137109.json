        "description": "Reject Humanity.\n\nRun, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb.\n\nThere are many different game modes - From an fun paintball battle or horror mode, with up to 10 of your friends.\n\nRun from the other monkey, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase monke down. Hang out in a virtual jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the PC versions of the game, so play with anyone on any platform.\n\nThere are many different levels to explore.  Each with their own topography that form routes and obstacles to play on.\n\nVisit our store in the City, with a rotating inventory of items to buy, play with, and wear to express your true monke fashion in a unique way.\n\nBecome Monkey.",
