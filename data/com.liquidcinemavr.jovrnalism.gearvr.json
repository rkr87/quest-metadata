The JOVRNALISM™ app is a diverse collection of our stories ranging from deportation to climate change to roller derby. Created in 2015 by Robert Hernandez, a digital professor at USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the hackathon-style course brings students from across the university to use a variety of emerging technologies and push innovative storytelling forward with compelling, human experiences.\n\nJOVRNALISM™ is generously support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Liquid Cinema, Google News Initiative, Mettle, Radiant Images and others.\n\nLearn more here: http://www.jovrnalism.io \n\nCinematic VR powered by Liquid Cinema™",
