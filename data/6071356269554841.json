        "description": "EZ360 combines an automatic 360Â° video player with remote video distribution. This allows you to distribute videos to headsets all over the world without the need to manually transfer video files to the computer.\n\nThe EZ360 Cloud application automatically downloads new videos that have been uploaded from the online portal. When the download is complete you can watch the video in the video player, even without internet connection. Playing a video is fully automatic. The video starts automatically when you put on a headset and when the headset is taken off, the video stops. This removes the hassle that other video players bring by providing a much easier interface. Manually preloading a VR headset with content is also possible.\n\nFeatures\n- Ultra user friendly\n- Add custom logo, background and video thumbnails\n- Mono + Stereoscopic 2d,180,360 videos (add \"_TB\" to video name)\n- Spatial Audio (.tbe)\n- .MP4\n- QHD quality\n- Oculus Go & Gear VR",
