Thanks to \nAntonis, it is now much clearer what you need to do, and how the app works! Interacting in Naer has also become even smoother with our latest improvements to telekinesis.\n\nWe also welcome you to a new lobby with crisp panels and the ability to create rooms without taking off your headset! Sharing a headset? No problem, you can change the name of your avatar and your appearance right from the lobby. You even get faster into the room you visited last time because now it’s right at the top of the list! Nice one, Stig.\n\nThanks to our Keeper of Keys, Ingrid, you can now create room codes to share with others! The room codes remove the need for pairing headsets or being a part of a team to join a session in VR. Neat. She has also done a lot of things you don’t see, working in the shadows (like Batman)."

Antonis and Bengt Ove made it harder to mute others by mistake and also made improvements to the look and feel of the name tags. You now see who’s talking, and who is muted.  \n\nTelekinesis is actually super hard to do well. Antonis has worked his a** off to provide you with better aiming, better animations, and better push and pull of content between you and the whiteboard. Based on where you look, we can now detect a whiteboard and understand if you intend to send the sticky note to the whiteboard or if you wish to delete it. It’s actually quite magical and even more natural to use. Try to look at the whiteboard while holding a sticky note and flicking your wrist like a wand and see for yourself!\n\nWant to listen to some sweet tunes in Naer? Stig has improved the audio quality of the screen share stream, so feel free to host your very own cave rave. When sharing your computer screen in Naer, the screen size will also adapt to the content you are sharing - cool right? Lastly, we have moved the screen to the left side of the whiteboard so you don’t lose any of the whiteboard content when sharing your screen.\n\nLastly we fixed a rare issue where people could get disconnected for no good reason."

It’s much more stable than before adding support for images, plain text, many shapes, and of course the humble sticky note.\n\nThanks to Ingrid, you can now create Miro boards directly from the web app. Newly created boards will automatically be added to your list of boards. She also made the onboarding super fast with auto-accepting invites if you already have an account.\n\nAlso, now might be a good time to beam your computer screen into Naer! \nStig has made screen sharing much more reliable, and updated our dependencies to the latest and greatest to ensure we’re using their latest and most bug free features. And, if you enable screen sharing in VR before casting from the web app, Bengt Ove added some instructions on how to cast your screen. \n\nLastly, Antonis has made improvements to super powers like telekinetic pulling, making it feel much more natural (really, try it. thank him later). Learning how to use Naer is now also easier since we have added videos to the tutorial, along with the already brilliant voice over. We also thought to align that mirror a bit better (mirror mirror on the wall, who is the best facilitator of them all?)."
