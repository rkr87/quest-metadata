Welcome to our new Standup Room, perfect for standups and more 'ordinary' meetings (though nothing here is ordinary)! This room features:\n\nFirst-of-its-kind Expandable Table: The table dynamically expands to the number of participants, offering a comfortable and adaptable space for any size meeting.\nBreak-out Zones: Dive into focused discussions with new breakout zones.\nHot Potato: Enjoy a fun and interactive way to share the speaking floor during meetings.\n\nüåê Brand New Web App!\nIngrid has worked hard to bring you a completely revamped web app experience. Built from the ground up, it‚Äôs now faster, more intuitive, and loaded with exciting new features.\n\nCheck it out on: https://app.naer.io/\n\nüì± Join from Phone!\nWe understand that sometimes you‚Äôre on the go or don‚Äôt have your headset handy, especially during your everyday standup. Thus, you can join a session from our web app using your phone! When you join, you‚Äôll appear in VR as a phone (which we think is hilarious). Check it out by creating a Standup room and join it from the web app.\n\nMake sure you join our community to talk to other Naerians, give feedback or submit feature-requests!\n\nCommunity: https://discord.gg/hYSNnBtE"

Now, your spray can include as many colors as the sticky notes! That means you can go completely bananas and let out your inner artist (or create some really nice SWOT-diagrams) - Thanks Antonis! \n\nAfter we made it so that you can create rooms directly from VR, we realized (after loving our own feature a bit too much) that it can become a bit messy with all the ‚ÄúWorkshop Rooms‚Äùs. Thanks to Ingrid, every new room now includes a numerical suffix to keep things organized. Furthermore, Stig has implemented a highly requested feature that allows you to delete rooms directly from the lobby. Pew pew to those old rooms you don't need anymore.\n\nSpeaking of Stig, he has also made the ability to share your screen even more performant. Did you know that you can use the screen share feature to cast some really nice tunes into Naer? 100% Cave-rave approved."

Thanks to \nAntonis, it is now much clearer what you need to do, and how the app works! Interacting in Naer has also become even smoother with our latest improvements to telekinesis.\n\nWe also welcome you to a new lobby with crisp panels and the ability to create rooms without taking off your headset! Sharing a headset? No problem, you can change the name of your avatar and your appearance right from the lobby. You even get faster into the room you visited last time because now it‚Äôs right at the top of the list! Nice one, Stig.\n\nThanks to our Keeper of Keys, Ingrid, you can now create room codes to share with others! The room codes remove the need for pairing headsets or being a part of a team to join a session in VR. Neat. She has also done a lot of things you don‚Äôt see, working in the shadows (like Batman)."

And, if you enable screen sharing in VR before casting from the web app, Bengt Ove added some instructions on how to cast your screen. \n\nLastly, Antonis has made improvements to super powers like telekinetic pulling, making it feel much more natural (really, try it. thank him later). Learning how to use Naer is now also easier since we have added videos to the tutorial, along with the already brilliant voice over. We also thought to align that mirror a bit better (mirror mirror on the wall, who is the best facilitator of them all?)."
