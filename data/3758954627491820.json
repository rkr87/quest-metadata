Yes, we did, but we have more goodies for you)\n\n‚ú®Automatic Pairing with Your Devices\nSay goodbye to pairing codes and having to log in from time to time (always when you‚Äôre already running late, right? üëÄ). Ingrid has been working her magic and made automatic pairing a reality ‚Äì you can now effortlessly pair your devices with Naer. Head over to app.naer.io, connect your account to Meta, and watch the magic happen. This will also make the rooms created on your device persistent and available in the web app, letting you access features like screenshare, Miro, and joining from phone (we‚Äôre still very much stoked about this feature).\n\nü•¢Super-Snappy Stickies\n*snap* ‚Äì that‚Äôs the sound of our humble sticky notes snapping to the board more beautifully than ever before, thanks to Antonis. He has also rolled out a bunch of minor fixes to make your experience in Naer feel like a dream.\n\nüé§No More Accidental Muting\nWe have all been there ‚Äì cracking your best joke, only to realize nobody heard it because you were muted. Hopefully, that won‚Äôt happen anymore, as you now will achieve a gentle reminder if you have muted yourself, muted others, or if others mute you. Oh, and we also added a speaking indicator to the nametags so you can see who‚Äôs speaking. \n\nü™∑Standup, better.\nYou asked, we listened. The screen in the standup room is now twice as big, so everyone can see and enjoy what‚Äôs being shared. We have also made the talking token timer only visible to the one talking, to remove distractions from what‚Äôs being said.\n\nüíé90FPS unlocked\n*mic-drop*.\n\nDo you have an amazing feature you would love to see in Naer or some feedback for us? Join our community on Discord and tell us all about it!\n\nCommunity: https://naer.io/discord\n"

Built from the ground up, it‚Äôs now faster, more intuitive, and loaded with exciting new features.\n\nCheck it out on: https://app.naer.io/\n\nüì± Join from Phone!\nWe understand that sometimes you‚Äôre on the go or don‚Äôt have your headset handy, especially during your everyday standup. Thus, you can join a session from our web app using your phone! When you join, you‚Äôll appear in VR as a phone (which we think is hilarious). Check it out by creating a Standup room and join it from the web app.\n\nMake sure you join our community to talk to other Naerians, give feedback or submit feature-requests!\n\nCommunity: https://discord.gg/hYSNnBtE"

Now, your spray can include as many colors as the sticky notes! That means you can go completely bananas and let out your inner artist (or create some really nice SWOT-diagrams) - Thanks Antonis! \n\nAfter we made it so that you can create rooms directly from VR, we realized (after loving our own feature a bit too much) that it can become a bit messy with all the ‚ÄúWorkshop Rooms‚Äùs. Thanks to Ingrid, every new room now includes a numerical suffix to keep things organized. Furthermore, Stig has implemented a highly requested feature that allows you to delete rooms directly from the lobby. Pew pew to those old rooms you don't need anymore.\n\nSpeaking of Stig, he has also made the ability to share your screen even more performant. Did you know that you can use the screen share feature to cast some really nice tunes into Naer? 100% Cave-rave approved."

Thanks to \nAntonis, it is now much clearer what you need to do, and how the app works! Interacting in Naer has also become even smoother with our latest improvements to telekinesis.\n\nWe also welcome you to a new lobby with crisp panels and the ability to create rooms without taking off your headset! Sharing a headset? No problem, you can change the name of your avatar and your appearance right from the lobby. You even get faster into the room you visited last time because now it‚Äôs right at the top of the list! Nice one, Stig.\n\nThanks to our Keeper of Keys, Ingrid, you can now create room codes to share with others! The room codes remove the need for pairing headsets or being a part of a team to join a session in VR. Neat. She has also done a lot of things you don‚Äôt see, working in the shadows (like Batman)."
