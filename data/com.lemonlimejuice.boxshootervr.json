        "description": "Do you want to get a full VR experience but feel like a huge 3D world is too much? Have you had enough with being a \"cruiser\" and just simply exist in a VR environment? In other words, do you want to immerse yourself in an experience that is \"simple enough\" for you to enjoy VR yet enjoy it more than being a passenger? Then Box Shooter VR is the experience for you. In this game you shoot boxes. Green boxes reward you with points, and stars reward you even more. White boxes add time to your experience while red ones subtract time. Your goal is to get as many points as you can while you have time. Its simple, its fun and most of all, you are in control!",
