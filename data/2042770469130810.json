        "description": "This application allows the user to listen to the music that is on their device within a virtual 3D space. A audio player menu is available to navigate through the music from their device. The user can customize the sky's colors as well as star's colors to match the mood that their music is emitting. This application is useful for immersing one's self into outer space and escaping into VR to experience their music in a new way. All music will be extracted from the /Music and /Download(s) folders on the user's device. The Oculus Go requires a controller to use the apps features.",
