        "description": "The lock-out-tag-out process (LOTO) is essential in protecting employees from hazardous conditions when servicing and maintaining machines and equipment on a job site.\n\nThis interactive simulation invites participants to explore and practice the steps involved with locking out and tagging out (LOTO) equipment in a safe environment. Based on information available through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website, this simulation guides participants though a background primer, providing context and identifying various parts used in this process. Next, participants engage in a sort-and-match activity which reinforces their understanding of the components and steps. Finally, participants explore a factory setting and put into practice what they learned by locking out and tagging out several control panels connected to manufacturing machinery.\nThe simulation provides instant feedback with either \"correct\" or \"try again\" responses to encourage participants to reconsider their choices and allows them to revisit any part of the simulation as often as needed.\nEmbedded learning objectives based on Bloom's revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying.\n\nBenefits include: \n• Realistic 3D Tools, equipment and environments \n• Interactive activities \n• Transferrable skills",
