        "description": "Join Wendy Martin, national award-winning science teacher, to guide you through a virtual reality cat dissection in Dissection Simulator: Feline Edition. Learn the fundamentals of the feline anatomy through its various systems in our fully immersive VR experience.\n\nThe entire program adheres to the Next Gen Science Standards (NGSS), America’s framework for science learning. In addition, we’ve implemented the processes and procedures of Carolina Biological--America’s leading supplier of science education materials. Using original and lifelike physical models, the dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail and is a comparable substitute for actual live specimen classroom dissections.\n\nSchools can save on expensive and rising annual costs of animal specimens. Additionally, acquisitions are reliable and not dependent on animal procurement. Learning pacing is user-controlled to ensure maximum understanding of the teaching while moving through the program.",
