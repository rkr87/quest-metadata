        "description": "Shennong: Taste of Illusion is a story based on ancient Chinese mythology about a mythical sage ruler of prehistoric China who catalogued hundreds of herbs by tasting them himself. One day, Shennong encounters an alluring flower and tastes it, mistakenly entering a mythical realm filled with mysterious creatures.\n\nJoin Shennong as he fights for his life and narrowly escapes death, with help from a magical friend. Expect stunning Chinese landscapes, thrilling fight sequences, and a beautiful soundtrack that incorporates traditional Chinese instruments to create an immersive adventure for viewers of all ages.\n\nShennong: Taste of Illusion is Pinta Studiosâ€™ second VR animation, following their popular debut, The Dream Collector. Shennong won the VRCore Best Sound Award for its soundtrack, and has also been nominated for and shown at festivals like the 75th Venice Film Festival, the Raindance Film Festival, and the Kaohsiung Film Festival.",
