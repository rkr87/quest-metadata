        "description": "How to play video: https://youtu.be/m6IE9wMSlYE\n\nAdmiral Wars breathes new life into the strategy game genre thanks to the capabilities of VR by putting you in the middle of the action. It’s not enough to out-maneuver or out-gun opponents, you must also protect the flagship at all costs. One lapse of concentration is all it takes for an opponent’s guns to line up right outside the starboard window, and if that happens, well… as they say, a good captain always goes down with the ship.\n\nAdmiral Wars is a VR game for players looking for a brand-new tactical experience that is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Anyone can learn to sail the waves, but it takes an experienced Admiral to conquer them. The game includes a VS AI mode, and a 1v1 multiplayer mode, with much more to be added in the future!\n\nPlayers who want to help contribute to the game's development are encouraged to join the studio Discord to chat with the developers: https://discord.gg/5fqtkZVHwR",
