        "description": "Casual Basketball game, that allows anyone to play 5-5 matches.\n\nIt should not cause VR discomfort, so the AI opponents are not fast paced and it's up to you whether you want fast or slow movement.\n\nYou are in the center of the game, it's designed to give you fun and relax, so expect plenty of points scored and opponent that will give you a lot of freedom.\n\nIf you want something more challenging, then you can increase the difficulty level or change other settings.\nBy default you get assisted throws, but if you prefer then you can enable precision throws, which are more difficult to perform.\n\nFor people that prefer more static play, there are some training modes that don't require movement.\n\nWARNING 1! If you have some ideas the please join us on Discord. We're open for discussion and we can push the game into specific directions.\nWARNING 2! Don't expect strict rules of Basketball.",
