You just got a job at the Populistan International Airport, but this is not your usual airportâ€¦ You'll have to prove that you are capable of being a security agent at this prestigious, absolutely 0% corrupt airport.\n\nYour job will consist of checking passports, making sure people are who they say they are and don't forge documentation, pat down people if you need to, find contraband and above all, follow the orders from your superior.\n\nNothing to Declare focuses on accessibility, and as such, you can play with one or two controllers. Both controllers are interchangeable to provide the best experience for every player!",
