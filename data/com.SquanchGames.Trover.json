Your dogs have been dognapped by a beaked lunatic who stuffed them into his eye holes and is using their life essence to destroy the universe. You're partnered with Trover, a little purple eye-hole monster who isn’t a huge fan of working or being put in the position of having to save the universe. Only you and Trover can save everything in this bizarre comedy adventure filled with combat, platforming, puzzles, and morally questionable choices – created by Justin Roiland! -Control Trover's movements, but not his mouth. He’s got a lot to say about what’s going on in the game. -Travel the cosmos to experience a variety of weird alien planets and characters with big personalities. -Upgrade Trover AND YOURSELF with new abilities while evading awkward situations. -Immerse yourself in weirdness.",
