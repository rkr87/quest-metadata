However, the 3dof handle has fewer keys, so downloading tools are not supported. We will improve the operation of the 3dof handle in subsequent updates.\n\nImportant Update: Support Oculus controller\n\n-Bullet Time: Rotating the handle can make the game screen enter the cool bullet time, the sense of the movie blockbuster.\n-Character Jumping: Tap the touchpad to jump high, and the battle on the roof is completely open!\n-Grenade Throwing: Raise the handle and press the trigger. The grenade can knock down a bunch of enemies.\n-New tutorial: animation guide, operation is no longer lost!\n\nChesstar"
