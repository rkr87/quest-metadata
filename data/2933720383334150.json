        "description": "When the sun got tired of humans and decided to hide and never rise again, darkness awoke the dead from their graves. Since then, the clash between man and zombie sets the pace of daily life.\n \nNarrated by Colin Farrell, “Gloomy Eyes” is an animated trilogy and emotional tale where fantastical animated dioramas twist and rotate around you. \n\nChase the nostalgic and heartwarming story of a zombie boy, Gloomy, and a human girl, Nena, that dare to play with love. Their star-crossed love might just be the last seed of hope.\n\nPremiered at Sundance Film Festival (2019), was awarded ‘Best VR experience’ at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival (2019) and winner of the ‘Jury Award for Storytelling’ SXSW (2019).",
