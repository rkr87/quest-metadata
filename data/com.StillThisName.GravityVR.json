        "description": "Gravity is a virtual reality music visualizer. As soon as you start, you will find yourself in the middle of an audio-reactive environment where you can switch visual themes and backgrounds, walk around and jump with the teleport. It is a VR version of the same-named audio-reactive app for Windows and Mac desktops.\nOculus version looks like a cube, the same as the Gravity concept. You are standing inside. You can switch between different minimalistic sound-reactive themes surrounding you.\nAnother thing you have control of is an audio-reactive geometric form in the middle. Press triggers on both hand controllers to switch between different types of inner and outer things. Press both triggers quickly to get the metamorphosis effect.",
