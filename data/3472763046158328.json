        "description": "From 1933 to 1945 the German Nazis performed the largest looting of cultural objects and personal belongings in history. Millions of artworks, antiques, and over 100 million books were stolen all over Europe. Special looting units were sent out to confiscate the most important and the most valuable art collections, libraries, and archives. Masterpieces by Rembrandt, Rubens, and van Gogh were stolen but also children’s books, pianos, jewelry, and personal letters.\n\nThe looting was a part of the Holocaust - A way to wipe out a people by depriving them of their history, culture, and humanity. Millions of items were never returned to their rightful owners after World War II. \n\nThe exhibition Plundering – the beginning of a genocide is based on the award-winning books by author and journalist Anders Rydell about the German Nazi plunder of art and literature in Europe.\n\nPlundering is produced by the Living History Forum in association with Folkets Hus och Parker and Immetropia.",
