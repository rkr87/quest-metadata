The multiplayer experience in Z-Race is designed to assure you’ll always have competitive opponents to play against, and not be stuck with ones that are too slow—or too fast—for your skill level. No matter how good you get at flying Formula Z, you’ll never be alone. The faster you are, the more competitive your rivals will become. A demo of our new Tournament mode in AppLab will allow you to experience the world of VR arcade racing and compete for real prizes.\nFeatures:\n● Beautiful, high-quality graphics\n● Specially designed to be comfortable to play, with no motion sickness\n● Innovative, simple controls\n● Asynchronous multiplayer",
