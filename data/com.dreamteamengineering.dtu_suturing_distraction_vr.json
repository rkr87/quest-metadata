        "description": "SuturingVR is primarily designed to be a highly immersive game that uses the unique aspects of virtual reality while also taking into consideration design constraints inherently imposed by the use-case situation: a child will primarily be using this before and during routine medical procedures, limited in motion in their hospital bed. Limited FOV, simple and intuitive controls, fluid motion, calming music, and immersive environments are all crucial to keeping the child comfortable.\n\nThis application is for use as a VR Distraction-Based Therapy tool in the study \"Feasibility and Acceptability of Virtual Reality to Reduce Perceived Pain and Anxiety Among Patients within a Hospital System\"",
