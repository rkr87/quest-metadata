        "description": "WANING: This app is in Early Access. It lacks songs and difficulties that will be added in the following weeks. Also, every level may be change or redo in the future.\n\nEmbark on an experience where ancient samurai traditions meet the pulsating beats of modern music. Samurai Beats is a virtual reality rhythm game that puts you in the shoes of a samurai, testing your skills, reflexes, and sense of rhythm like never before. Are you ready to step into a world where harmony and precision are the keys to victory?\n\nThe game mechanics are designed to keep you fully immersed and engaged. As the rhythmic patterns flow through your ears, it's up to you to synchronize your movements and swiftly slice through the bamboo, matching the beats and maintaining an unbroken flow. The seamless integration of virtual reality allows you to physically wield your katana, making each slice feel exhilarating real.\n\nBut the path to becoming a true samurai is not without its perils. Beware of the arrows that rain down upon you, as a single mistake can prove fatal. Dodge, sidestep, and maneuver your way through the storm of projectiles while never losing your rhythm. Let the music guide your every move and lead you to victory.",
