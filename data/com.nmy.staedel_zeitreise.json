        "description": "What did Frankfurt’s Städel Museum look like in the nineteenth century? The “Time Machine” is a virtual reality app that provides fascinating insights into the architecture of the art museum and how it presented its collection in 1878. Wander through the 3D reconstructions of the collection rooms and find out which of your favourite works were already in the museum back then – and how they were displayed.\n\nIn two tours designed especially for this app, you can get to know highlights of our collection and learn interesting facts about the history of the museum. The building’s architecture is also a topic here. Another option is to explore the Städel Museum of the year 1878 on your own.\n\nThe “Time Machine” is the result of in-depth research. The digital depiction of the historical Städel – the first reconstruction ever offered of a prominent civic museum collection – shows how time-bound our ways of viewing artworks are.",
