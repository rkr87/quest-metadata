        "description": "As a photographer and VR enthusiast I have always dreamed about a way of expressing photography as close as possible to the actual moment of capture, about the moment when reality and photography converge. The first trial was a couple of years ago when I took some photos and made a short film based on the famous parallax techniques but with a twist. The twist was that everything was now in actual 3d and not just 2D layers. The next step was giving the viewer a bit of input and so came to be the online WebGL version. The final step was full immersion; VR was only the natural step forward. \nmore info on how this was achieved : http://aurelm.com/2013/12/15/fernweh-3d-parallax-photography-tutorial/",
