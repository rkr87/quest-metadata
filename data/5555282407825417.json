Water magic is a combination of water and ice abilities that focus on fluid attacks for water and precise sharp motions for ice. There are 10 new abilities to try and one passive; these can all be found in the sandbox.\n\nNEW ABILITIES\nThe passive for water is Ice Walker which lets you walk/run faster on ice.\n\nSplash- A water splash that does light damage in a moderate area of attack.\n\nWater whip - Summon a water whip that can be shot forward and returned to your hand. Very effectively at hitting enemies at long range.\n\nWater tentacle - Summon a water tentacle, a powerful ability that can swipe, grab and throw enemies. Any part of the environment can be gripped with the tip of the tentacle, you can then swing or pull yourself up making it a great ability for exploring.\n\nWater ball - A ball of water that can be manipulated and combined with other water sources to grow larger, doing moderate damage this ball can also be used defensively. Targeting the water ball will turn it into a powerful ice attack.\n\nIce shard - A sharp ice shard that can penetrate enemies and the environment. Ice shards can be collected once cast and used to scale walls to stab enemies with.\n\nIce shuriken - Fast summon an ice shuriken. Deals high frost damage but does require some skill to be accurate.\n\nFrost - A frost spray that can freeze enemies and the environment. Freezing the ground will create a slippery surface that will give you a speed boost thanks to your passive.\n\nIce storm - A blast of ice shards that is super effective at close range.\n\nIce bomb - A very cold frost attack that will freeze everything around it.\n\nSnap freeze - Target a wet enemy to freeze it instantly, you need to be close to the enemy to do this.\n\nOTHER CHANGES\n- Frost damage is added to the damage system\n- Frost damage will appear blue on damage numbers\n- Water abilities now put out fire abilities\n- Water abilities can slow down incoming earth abilities\n- All water spells can wet enemies\n- Enemies can now be frozen with frost abilities and defrosted with heat abilities\n- Frozen enemies can be shattered with a physical attack\n- Enemies can be wet, wet enemies will be slower and can be frozen easier\n- Players now have more control when walking on ice\n- A crashed airship has been added to the story mode map (more on this later)\n\nBUG FIXES\n- Decals now work on PCVR \n- Passthrough attacks like gust now correctly pass through objects"
