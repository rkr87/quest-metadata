        "description": "Metacity Patrol: The Future of Law Enforcement!\n\n(Early access - still in development)\n\nStep into the neon-soaked, dystopian world of Metacity, where deception and danger lurk around every corner. \n\nAs a new recruit in Metacity Law Enforcement, you’ll navigate an expansive world teeming with possibilities and peril. Your mission, to restore order to a city in the grips of a synthetic crime wave.\n\nFrom the highest skyscrapers to the deepest alleyways, Metacity is yours to discover. Whether you’re soaring through the skies in your air car or walking the rain-drenched streets, there’s always something new to find.\n\nRespond to HQ calls in real-time. Collect evidence, neutralize illegally modified synthetics, interrogate suspects, and scan the city for criminal activity—all within a living, breathing metropolis.\n\nAlternatively, take a break from the badge and dive into high-speed street races. Or go off-duty to experience life as a Metacitizen.\n\nPersonalize your weapon and gloves to suit your style. Buy property, upgrade your air car for better performance, and invest in cutting-edge implant technology to sharpen your stats.",
