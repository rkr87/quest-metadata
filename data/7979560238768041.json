        "description": "Welcome to Bullet Style! An all-new roomscale virtual reality shooter that immerses players in action-packed gunfights using real movement. Become the action hero of your dreams and experience intense combat by navigating seemingly endless levels with your own two feet. Blast bad guys with an extensive arsenal of weaponry, fend off hordes of zombies, and play through a variety of different game modes that keep the adrenaline pumping!\n\nBullet Style requires a minimum of 6.5 feet by 6.5 feet to be played with real movement. A larger play area will improve the game experience. Thumbstick controls can be enabled for stationary play, but this is not recommended.\n\nBullet Style is currently in early access and may contain bugs or other issues. Please report any bugs to contact@adventurousstudios.com. ",
