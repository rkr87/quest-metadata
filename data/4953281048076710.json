        "description": "Solicitude Wake-up takes you to seemingly abandoned research facility. You wake-up in a dark operating room, laying down on operating table. As you start finding your way out from the facility, you start to hear voices coming from other parts of the facility and face all kinds of disturbing things . Your only help is the flashlight, that you found from the room that you woke up, but unfortunately it is running out of batteries.\n\nExplore the rooms around the facility and collect batteries to keep your flashlight working! There are key cards to be found and you can access more rooms after obtaining new key card. Avoid the monsters during your way and learn how different monsters work to make your task easier.\n\nWelcome to the VR horror in 2021!",
