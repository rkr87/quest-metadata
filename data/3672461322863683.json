        "description": "Fetal Heart VR is a self-teaching tool to learn geometry, anatomy, and function of Congenital Heart Diseases.\n\nWith the app, you can make a virtual ultrasound scan of normal and abnormal heart models and learn specific anatomical and geometrical features typical for Congenital Heart Diseases. The controller simulates the ultrasound probe - by moving it like an ultrasound probe you can obtain all recommended fetal cardiac views for prenatal examination\n\nWith the Fetal Heart VR, we hope to enable a more personal, affordable opportunity to learn how to perform ultrasound scans, available for all professionals involved in prenatal sonography.\n\nThis version includes a healthy fetal heart as well as 14 Congenital Heart Defects: tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), Transposition of the Great Arteries (dTGA, lTGA),  hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS MS-AA, HLHS MAAA), Critical Aortic Stenosis (CritAS), Atrio-Ventricular Septal Defect (AVSD, uAVSD) Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) and more.",
