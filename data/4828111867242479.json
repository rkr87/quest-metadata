        "description": "BIM design and coordination solution for architecture, engineering and construction that connect all project members on one immersive, collaborative, real-time platform regardless of device and model size. Transfer your BIM data from Revit, Navisworks, SketchUp, and Rhino into real-time 3D experiences on a range of devices to bridge the gap between design and construction.\nUnity Reflect allows you to:\n• Visualize BIM (Building Information Modelling) models on your Quest device, phone, or tablet by connecting to a Unity Reflect server.\n• Filter your model based on its BIM metadata and highlight systems and components independently.\n• Attach comments to objects in your model on Annotation mode and also see and reply to any comments left by your colleagues.\nIn order to make your model available to the Unity Reflect app, you must first publish it to a Unity Reflect server. To do so, simply install a Unity Reflect plugin in your design application and tap the Export or the Sync button.",
