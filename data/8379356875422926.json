The courses will now be available to purchase under \"Courses\" from app.kanda.dk.\n\nCourse preview: GWO BTT-M module\nWe are in the development phase with BTT Mechanical and it will be launched in Preview-mode with the next release. As always, we would love your feedback and hope that you will enjoy the early access. \n\nPlease check out the new training course and test its capabilities.\n\n- Get introduced to the BTT-M course\n- Get familiar with the appropriate PPE for handling mechanical systems\n- Learn about Feeler Gauge, Dial Gauge, Callipers, and Dial Test Indicator in the Measuring Tools Room\n- Get hands-on experience using Torque Wrench, Hydraulic Tensioner and Pump, Torque Screwdriver, and Allan Key in the Nacelle Room\n- Learn how to calibrate a Torque Screwdriver and Torque Wrench\n\nPlease note that the course is under development, so you might experience some weird behaviors. We would love some feedback on your experiences.\n\nOnboarding to Offshore update\n\n- The scenario has been split up into three smaller chunks, so you can get into the first one faster, without having to load it all up-front.\n- The legacy menu UI has been swapped with the new VTP menu.\n- The Transfer Vessel + Tower Platform section has gotten a new mechanic: a light weight version of the Slinger Signaller Lift Ops experience.\n- The tower-to-nacelle teleport button has been replaced with an animated sequence. Just enter the lift, and it will get you to the top.\n\nGWO BTT-H module is content complete\nOur BTT-H course is now content complete. We’ve added more tools, facilities and exercises such as:\n\n- Explore hydraulic components using a nacelle scale model\n- Solidify your ability to read and write hydraulic diagrams using the interactive board\n- Lean how to assemble and operate an accumulator\n- Learn how to operate a pump for hydraulics\n- Make your own setups in the hydraulic sandbox, where you can assemble and test a range of hydraulic equipment\n- Place hydraulic components in the context of a nacelle\n\nApp Updates\n- We have updated the lobby, so it is simpler to use for trainees. To join a session, just type the 4-digit code provided by your trainer.\n- We’ve added experimental support for localization, allowing the user to set their preferred app language. Currently, the Kanda lobby and menus can be localized to languages such as English, German, and Spanish."
