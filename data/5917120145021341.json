The main UI change is that the buttons B/Y can now be used to go back when you are not inside an immersive video or application. Additionally, we have cleaned up our resizing logic to make it more predictable, which also improves how fullscreen videos (both horizontal and vertical) are presented. Keyboard and dialogs are more visible when you have multiple browser windows open. Finally, we have added four new environments for you to try out."
