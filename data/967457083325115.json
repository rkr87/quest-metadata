Bait! had an almost instantaneous relaxation effect. Once you get started and cast your first line, everything else in life disappears and you’re truly in the moment – I bet my pulse even went down.” - Maarten Noyons, founder of IMGA \n\n“Bait! is one of those pleasant games for everyone.” - VRScout\n\nYou’re invited to Bait! Island to help your boss catch a rare fish, and thereby save the struggling aquarium where you work.\n\nDuring the game, you will catch a lot of different fish and make friends with the locals. But, will you be able to keep your loyalties both to your new friends and to your boss?\n\nGameplay spans four different lakes, each with a distinct style and its own unique set of fishes. Can you catch them all?",
