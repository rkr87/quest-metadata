        "description": "Everyone has a story, and we all love stories - from any country of the world. The age-old stories told by our grandma is still vivid in our mind and they all have unique lessons to teach without preaching. These indigenous stories teach us about preserving habitat, good health and more using funny animals or characters that inspire our imagination. The story uses a fireside narrative style and uses some animations of the central character but does not use cartoon style simulation so that those who are listening to the story can also \"visualize\" their own imagery.\nFeature\nThe first story that the app has is a short story based on a native folklore from Ancient India adapted and inspired from the Jataka tales and can be replayed again with the guide and narrator.\nThe story is aligned with UN Sustainability goals 2030 and this story focuses on an ancient story of a wise animal and his plan to save the forest and its biodiversity. This scene has teleport positions to move in the scene. ",
