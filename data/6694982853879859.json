        "description": "ENORMOUS COMBAT UPDATE!\n\nIn this Metroid-inspired classic FPS adventure, you discover an abandoned lab in Antarctica overrun by monstrous beasts. You then find a set of gloves that prints living organisms usable as weapons and tools. William, the sole survivor, is in your head via radio. He appeals to your emotions. But can you trust him?\n\nOn February 8, 2024 we released an update that dramatically improves combat! Some of the changes:\n\nüî´ 5 new radically different weaponized organisms\nüí™ New upgrade system giving you more choice in how you deal with enemies\nüöß Improved combat spaces to enhance your adrenaline flow\nüëæ New enemies, fine-tuned behaviors, and better boss fights\nüí∞ Rebalanced loot amounts and ammo costs\nü•µ Four difficulty settings\nüìù Even more lore to find in the facility\n‚ûï Atmospheric synth-scapes, resolution equal to PCVR, and much more.\n\nSlay an abundance of enemies, big and small! With what‚Äôs scattered in the facility, you use their guts to upgrade your organisms and the gloves that print them.\n\nThe World is mazy and open, so backtrack and maximize exploration and looting. Morph into a tiny beetle to negotiate narrow passageways using your Brainlink creature, or rip obstacles apart with the Grubber. An epic boss battle awaits at the story‚Äôs crescendo, and a penguin will break your heart. It‚Äôs OK, just save the World.\n\nGenotype is a beautiful Meta Quest 2 game perfectly updated for Meta Quest 3 and Oculus Rift.\n",
