        "description": "# The Future Of Anesthesia Education\n\nPerfect your skills and build the confidence required to be successful in a real operating room. SIMVANA's Simulations offer instant access to a variety of real-world situations.\n\nPractice basic intubations or handle rare complications, all in the comfort of your own home, at your own pace. Each simulation is randomized to provide a fresh challenge on every run through.\n\n![{\"height\":1272,\"type\":\"image\",\"width\":2462}](https://scontent-iad3-2.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/39003240_500322202339827_7224856601963774083_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6e7a0a&_nc_ohc=JCrNtCvuD0QQ7kNvgEW7iE4&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AYARpAI3OEl84qyMPVgWibsE__Z5fmt4nxxlbZbUIebpVA&oe=6702667B)\n\n# Learn in your own virtual operating room\n\nSIMVANA's library of learning content puts learners on the fast track of anesthesia education. Our mix of multimedia content, contextual quizzes and interactive objectives maximize retention and engagement of learning material.\n\nMaster the fundamentals of the anesthesia machine, pharmacology, airway management and more with our growing library of learning content.\n\n![{\"height\":1350,\"type\":\"image\",\"width\":2560}](https://scontent-iad3-2.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/86615252_1117964725975934_5143383394315896553_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6e7a0a&_nc_ohc=d5ueGThu9oMQ7kNvgHBXvTi&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AYB8hw73yt3622vqeO2Fa-pvXi480ifu4Q-GIcC57sgQlg&oe=67025896)\n\n# Explore in a safe virtual environment\n\nSIMVANA's open world design empowers the user with the freedom to make their own decisions. Explore and experiment in way that would be impossible in a real world environment. Our powerful physiology simulation engine running underneath it all ensures that the simulation will respond quickly and accurately.\n\n![{\"height\":1002,\"type\":\"image\",\"width\":2560}](https://scontent-iad3-1.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/75458095_1200863877758421_3021165941756304483_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6e7a0a&_nc_ohc=Ver_6Mya8bQQ7kNvgEgo7t8&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AYDTjoZu1Tbic-56qCCLDKwmhy1Bc8tysSkQi0VbQ0-M6Q&oe=67025273)",

Our existing Endotracheal Intubation, Rapid Sequence Intubation, and Supraglottic Airway placement sims have been updated to be more open ended and in line with our other simulations.\n\nWe’ve also added a new Induction Complications simulation that give users an extra challenge of identifying and resolving issues in the OR while intubating a patient.\n\nLastly, we’ve added more variations to our worst break ever simulation to increase keep people on their toes in SIMVANA’s most difficult simulation.\n\n** Custom Lesson Planning **\n\nInstructors and Program Directors can now create custom lesson plans for their students using SIMVANA! Custom lesson plans show up directly in the headset, and allow instructors to create their own set of lessons to complete.

This update of SIMVANA includes many smaller improvements and bug fixes:\n\n- Surgeon and Scrub nurse avatars now animate to bring more life to the OR\n- All video and image media displayed in the learning content is loaded locally. This greately reduces the amount of bandwidth needed for an optimal SIMVANA experience.\n- Improvements to the patient physiology simulation allow for more realistic responses to a wider variety of user actions\n- Patient breathing simulation has been updated to handle a wider variety of user actions."
