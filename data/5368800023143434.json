        "description": "You can increase your speed by holding down the A button of the right controller. Shoot your enemies with the Primary button of the right controller. Reduce your speed with the Secondary button.\n\nYou can steer your plane with the left controller joystick. You can switch between Safe mode and Free mode with the X button. But watch out! With Free mode, your plane will be faster and more acrobatic. If you have difficulty controlling your plane, you can switch to Safe mode with the X button again. Safe mode will position you on the right axis.\n\nThe life value of each aircraft appears on it. The plane with a life value of 0 explodes. Exploding planes will respawn at zero point. You can shoot as many planes as you want without any limit and spend as much time as you want.\n\nEach warzone is for 20 people. \n\nDon't forget! Everyone on the battlefield is full of people who want to experience the plane like you, and enemies who want to shoot you down!",
