        "description": "Welcome to Snowball Party! Immerse yourself in a magical snow-covered world where fun meets fitness. Armed with a snowball gun, your mission is to hit the dancing gnomes that pop up around you. But here's the twist: the gnomes wear the faces of your teammates, customized with real photos, adding a hilarious, personal touch to your game!\n\nAs you play, these cheeky gnomes toss snowballs back, challenging you to physically move left and right, ducking and dodging, turning the game into an exhilarating exercise. Perfect for parties or team-building, Snowball Party bridges the gap between virtual and real worlds. Non-players aren't left out; they can watch the snowy battles unfold on a TV, streaming live from your headset. Whether you're aiming for a high score or just a hearty laugh, this game promises a blizzard of fun for everyone!\n\nIn order to have your own faces appear on the gnomes check out the guide under the support link!",
