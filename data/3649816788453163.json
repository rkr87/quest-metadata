Our team is small and progress has been slow, especially with the development of the multiplayer version. We understand the frustration and disappointment this has caused, but we assure you that we are doing our best to improve the game within our capabilities.\n\nWith this update, we have fixed many of the bugs reported by the community, such as the inability to save, issues with the usage of the storage chests, and optimization of the interaction with items. Additionally, we have improved the tutorials for new players and made changes to the way items are picked up and used. The textures and English language have also been optimized.\n\nWe would like to thank you for your support and feedback, and we hope you will continue to enjoy playing A Floating World. We promise to do our best to make the game better for all players.\n\nSincerely,\nThe A Floating World Development Team."
