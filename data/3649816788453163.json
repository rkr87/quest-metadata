Additionally, we have improved the tutorials for new players and made changes to the way items are picked up and used. The textures and English language have also been optimized.\n\nWe would like to thank you for your support and feedback, and we hope you will continue to enjoy playing A Floating World. We promise to do our best to make the game better for all players.\n\nSincerely,\nThe A Floating World Development Team."
