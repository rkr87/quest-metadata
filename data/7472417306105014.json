        "description": "Sphere Guys is a gorilla tag locomotion game based on the popular game \"Gorilla Tag.\" It features multiplayer functionality, allowing you to create private rooms and play with your friends! If you want to play with random people, we recommend joining codes 1, 2, or 3, as these are the most popular.\n\nThere are multiple fun game modes, such as Parkour, which has easy, medium, and hard levels. Another mode is Chase, where a scary ghost chases you! In the Space mode, you experience zero gravity, just like in actual space. You also get a rocket controlled by the player's hand and trigger button to move around easily.\n\nIn Dropper, you drop from a high place and try to land in a pool while avoiding obstacles. In Rising Lava, a volcano erupts, and you need to survive by navigating an obstacle course. The Hangout mode has three different islands, representing Autumn, Winter, Summer, and Spring.\n\nThe game also features a mall with plenty of cosmetics to choose from and bundles at great prices. Inside the mall, there is an entire pool map with multiple slides, an actual movie theater, and more content coming soon!",
