You join her quest to unravel the past that he can no longer talk about, and discover how his relationship to words is connected to his memories. \n\nStep by step, clue after clue, you will dive alongside her into the inner world of this man transported to the mysterious territory of Aphasia, shown as a black & white, surrealist landscape.\n\nWith one-of-a-kind art direction, EMPEROR is an intimate, touching story that will leave a lasting mark on your minds.\n\n*This experience begins in a seated position, but plan now for a large enough space around you as you’ll be asked to stand up during the experience\n\n*Best suited for hand-tracking\n\n*Narrated by Olivia Cooke (House of the Dragon, Ready Player One)\n\n*Brought to you by the award-winning studio ATLAS V (Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway, Madrid Noir), EMPEREUR is co-produced with Reynard Films and France Televisions, directed by Marion Burger & Ilan J.
