        "description": "Pompeii is an experience allowing you to visit the most famous ruins of Pompeii, Italy. Feeling like you are really there, you can walk along one of Pompeii's main streets, visit the interior of an extraordinarily well preserved Roman house, experience the hustle and bustle of Pompeii's bars and shops, visit two beautiful Roman gardens, and finally get to experience what is was like bathing in a 2000 year old Roman bathhouse. This experience allows you to enter and explore Pompeii with an unrivaled freedom of movement. You can walk right up beautifully painted walls and mosaics which are cordoned off in real life. The experience contains a large source of highly entertaining narrative content, allowing one to really understand what living here as a Roman must have been like. In our view this is the closest thing you will ever get to feeling like you are in Pompeii without actually having to fly to Italy and be there yourself.",
