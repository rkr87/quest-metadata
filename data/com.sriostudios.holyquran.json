        "description": "The Quran was begun to be revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad(SAV) in the Hira Cave on Mount Nur in Mecca on the Night of Power of Ramadan in 610. Since the Quran was completed with the pass away of the Prophet Muhammad(SAV), it was not collected while he was alive, but preserved by memorization. One of the oldest examples of the Quran, which was later turned into a book, is currently on display at the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.\n\nIt is definitely known that the content of the Quran is not changed and cannot be changed, it is sent by Allah as a healing and mercy to people. But except the wrongdoers!\n\nIn the lights of this information, this application has been developed to help transmit this miraculous book, which was sent to guide people in divine search, to people through virtual reality.\n\nIn the following years, we will continue to work with great determination to ensure that the entire book is transferred to virtual reality environment and that all humanity can benefit from it",
