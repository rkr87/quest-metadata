If not, you can also check the cloud saves and try restoring* a save via https://secure.oculus.com/my/cloud-backup/\n\n*Unless you are trying to restore a save made in a beta version of the game. Just please don't do this, the pre-release saves are incompatible with the current build, and we don't know how many potential problems this action can cause. \n\n2. Adjusted pistol shooting angle (will also add a customizable setting for that in the future)\n3. Adjusted pistol recoil\n4. Balanced shotgun damage (reduced it)\n5. Improved the weapon holsters behind your back"
