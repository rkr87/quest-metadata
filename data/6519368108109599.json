        "description": "The mission of Orbis is to transport you to the most iconic and beautiful locations of North and South America, but with a focus on locations that are off the beaten track.\n\nInitially we will be focusing on Peru's archaeological wonders, starting with Machu Picchu but also including some of the more remote locations that people rarely get a chance to see. These include Choquequirao, considered as Peru's hidden Machu Picchu, accessible only with a four-day hike into the wilderness. We will be revealing the secrets of Peru's Sacred Valley, with its beautiful waterfalls and archaeological sites. Our desire is to take you deep into parts of Peru that are often ignored by tour guides and create an experience where you see something unique, something different, something much closer to what Peru is all about.\n\nWe will gradually be expanding to other areas of North and South America, with this same idea in mind: to show you the amazing wonders, but always going off the beaten track so that you see something unique that has never been seen before. Whether it is deep inside a forest in New England during the foliage season, or close to a beautiful cave in Mexico known only by locals, our aim is the same: to make you feel transported and wake up the explorer within you.\n\nWe will be using the latest 3-D computer graphics and video technologies to bring everything to life and give you that feeling that you normally only get by actually being there.",
