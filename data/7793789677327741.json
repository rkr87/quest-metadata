This new flying type gives you a workout whilst also allowing you to experience the magic of bird flight. This flying type is currently immune from damage and unable to blast other players either, so consider it a good pacifist option during Multiplayer matches.\n\nNew FX Features:\nBlaster - Fire powerful energy bolts from your aura to blast other players out of the sky!\nShield - Channel the powers of the Aegis to block incoming energy blasts. Press B or X to use.\nPing - Amplify your aura to let other players know where to come and find you…or taunt your enemies. Press in the right stick to trigger.\nTrail - Paint your name in the sky with an improved visual on the trail.\nPlayer Field FX - The hit-box of other players now echoes the mysterious energy field surrounding the city…the Aegis.\n\nImprovements:\nSystem and graphical performance enhancements allow the game experience to be smoother than ever before.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nVarious quality-of-life fixes that, whilst important, are far too boring to write up for Patch Notes."

Set your fastest time flying through all the gates and challenge the world to do it faster.\n\nAim Guide!\nSqueeze and hold the trigger halfway to display your shot direction to better aim your blaster.
