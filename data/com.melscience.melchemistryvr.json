        "description": "MEL Chemistry is a course of chemistry lessons in virtual reality, made to fit the school curriculum, where virtual reality turns studying into an entertaining process for learning about the rudiments of chemistry, using scientific games and the immersion method.\n\nBecome a researcher in a scientific laboratory.\nDive into solids and gases to learn about their structure on the atomic and molecular level. Construct any atom on your own with a special constructor and learn about electron configuration.\n\nDonâ€™t memorize, understand!\nImmersing yourself in the subject of study makes it a lot easier to comprehend chemistry. Complex concepts become visual, and the ability to interact makes studying fun and entertaining.\n\nInside you will find multiple lessons that follow the basic school curriculum. There are also simple tasks and tests that will help you absorb more knowledge.",
