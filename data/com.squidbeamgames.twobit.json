        "description": "Twobit is a really unique VR puzzle-platform game. Only using your gaze or the VR Controller, guide a little robot in strange rooms and help him solve problems and puzzles. Twobit awakens in a dark and mysterious place. But he is not alone. He sees you. You are his guide. When he asks for direction, look around and find a location for him to explore. When he finds a button, nod you head in agreement to activate it. Need to see what lurks in the dark? Activate the Twobit Vision and see the world through his eyes. But who is Twobit and, most importantly, who are you? Are you a figment of his imagination? Can you and Twobit find a way to escape this pending doom and ultimately unravel the mysteries of this dark and enigmatic place? Twobit is a demo of Twobit Odyssey now available in the Oculus Store!",
