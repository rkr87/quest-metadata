        "description": "VR Sparring Partner is a boxing training application to improve counter attacks from parries and blocks.\n\nThe features of this work are as follows.\n\n1.Importance of counterpunching\nBy parrying or blocking an opponent's punch, the damage inflicted on the opponent is increased for a certain period of time. This allows you to practice quickly connecting from defense to counterpunch.\n\n2.Realistic damage calculations\nRealistic damage calculations based on the angle and speed of a punch against an opponent's weak spot allow you to practice punching faster and more accurately.\n\n3.Extensive customization functions\nIn Ordered Partner mode, you can customize your partner's behavior from a number of options. You can practice repetitive counters to various types of combination punches.\n\n4.Distinctive Partners\nThere are two types of partners: short-range and long-range. They also vary in the type and speed of the punches they throw, as well as in their physique. You can choose your partner according to your level and objectives.\n\n5.Stance change function\nChoose your partner's stance from both orthodox and southpaw. You can choose either orthodox or southpaw stance. This helps you to overcome your weak stance.\n\nBy playing this title, which was created to combine both gameplay and training effectiveness, you can perform effective boxing training at home, alone, and in a short period of time.\n\nNow, let's start training!",
