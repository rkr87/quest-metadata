        "description": "--- FREE FIRST CHAPTER---\n* Full Game available now !  *\n\nYou have been kidnapped by peculiar alien creatures. They want to unleash The Greatest Power of the Galaxy, to finally rule the galaxies and worlds beyond. For centuries, they have been looking for a master illusionist able to control this universal force. Only a human magician can unlock the mysterious apparatus sealed by Houdini’s great great Aunt Maggie. But be careful, those creatures do not like failure...\n\nBuilt from the ground up with apelab's SpatialStories creation toolkit, Break a Leg is an interactive adventure designed for the Gear VR controller. Inspired by the magic shows of the 19th century, it immerses you in the offbeat adventures of an improvised magician who will have to go through multiple stages of a conjurer’s performance without missing a beat.\n\nLet the show begin!",
