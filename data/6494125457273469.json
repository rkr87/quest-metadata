        "description": "Strayed is an open-world multiplayer VR survival game focused on player vs player interaction. Explore randomly generated islands, abandoned structures, and the vast wilderness to gather resources for survival. But be aware; There are dozens of other online players with the same goal.\n\nYou and dozens of other online players all share the same goal: survive by any means necessary.\n\nYou find yourself stranded on an island with no recollection of how you got there. With no means to escape, you must learn to adapt to your surroundings. With only a rock and a torch at your disposal, you must gather resources to craft tools to improve your chance of surviving. Crafting tools such as hatchets, pickaxes, or primitive weapons will aid you in taking on your surroundings, but be warned, you are not alone.\n\nBuild a place to call home for you and your loot.\n\nUpgrade your base with new materials you gather while in the wild (Wood, Stone, Metal). Start by placing your core foundation, from there you can expand with floors, walls, doorways and ceilings. Place deployables in your base such as storage boxes, furnaces, or beds to help you store your loot, set a spawn point, or make advancements with your materials.\n\nDon’t get too familiar with your surroundings, as everything will regenerate weekly.\n\nProcedurally generated every Monday, no two islands are the same, meaning you will never play on the same map for longer than one week at a time.",

We have not yet been able to reproduce this. It is possible that improved player connection handling may solve this issue. If you experience a cleared inventory (player or any deployable) please submit a bug report with as much detail as possible.\n- Force quitting the game does not disconnect you properly from the server. The next time you join the server you will be rejected, sent back to the main menu, and receive a message stating an unknown error had occurred. The next time you rejoin the server you will be good to go as normal. To avoid this issue please return to the main menu prior to force quitting the game. We will be working on an improved solution to this soon."
