Setting up your environment is easy: you can select from a variety of backgrounds, then drag and drop the models you want from the included 3D library. You can resize, rotate and place each model in your scene, and decide whether they are static or can be grabbed, are influenced by gravity...\nOnce you are set you can bring your environment to live using Zoe's interactive system. Program a full experience using an intuitive set of customizable conditions and actions. And of course, you can play it at any time. Have learning about how to create unique interactive experiences !",

It may happen that an object without collision activated still triggers collisions.\n- Sketchfab: when the limit of downloads (50) has been reached the App loses all connection to Sketchfab (even changing accounts displays the same error).\n- Sketchfab: the cache of downloaded assets does not always retrieve them properly if connection was lost during a session.\n- Sketchfab: sometimes after adding a model from sketchfab, then closing the library, the model disappears. Usually the model is still in the memory but not visible, either go to Play and back to Edit, or kill the App and open it again; you should be able to see your model again. To avoid this, make sure you wait until the preview of the model has loaded AGAIN before selecting another asset or closing the library.\n"
