        "description": "January 16, 2024: The Meta Quest 3 Update for The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is live! Meta Quest 3 players will find in the update:\n\n- Increased walker count (up to 100% more walkers)\n- Better materials, shades, reflections, post-processing effects\n- Increased texture resolution and level of detail\n- New dynamic light sources and shadows\n- Additional layers of dirt, grime, and other texture overlays\n- Dynamic shadows added to the flashlight to increase impact of dark maps\n- Increased bloom, lighting, fire, and fog fidelity\n- And much more!\n\nFace all the horrors that the living and the dead can offer in this new VR adventure in The Walking Dead universe. Travel through the ruins of walker infested New Orleans as you fight, sneak, scavenge, and survive each day unraveling a city wide mystery within the iconic quarters. Encounter desperate factions and lone survivors who could be friend or foe. Whether you help others or take what you want by force, every choice you make has consequences. What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? \n \nScavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues.\n \nBe wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise.\n \nCraft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more.\n \nSurvive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others.\n \nTest your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.",

Today, we would like to reveal one such way we are working to make the experience even better for our players, alongside some news and details that may be relevant to you.\n\nUpcoming Quick Start Feature\nWhile Aftershocks is intended to be played after you have reached the credits, we understand that some players may find themselves without a completed save file and not wanting to play through the entirety of the game again just to see the what's new.\n\nTo satisfy these players, we plan to implement a quick start option that will allow you to jump straight into the Aftershocks content without finishing a playthrough. This feature will be implemented in a patch following shortly after the initial update, so if you do not have a post-game save file yet, you can choose to wait for this feature. \n\nWe thank you again for all your support, and are very excited for you all to enjoy what Aftershocks has to offer."
