They do more damage than bullets. WW2 airplanes do not carry rockets since their bullets already do more damage.\n\n- Team Dogfight mission now requires only 15 kills. (Thanks Outlaw_war and AceGirl)\n\n- Lowered the price of all paints.\n\n- Improved some airplanes graphics.\n\n- Improved performance on several fronts."
