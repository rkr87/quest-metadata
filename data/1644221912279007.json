        "description": "What happens when you arrive early for a Mexican fiesta?  In busuu’s Spanish Learning Game you arrive at a beautiful Mexican hacienda, are greeted by a telepresence robot, taught to speak some Spanish and asked to help the delightfully odd Mendoza family to get ready for the party!\n\nAs you learn new Spanish phrases, you get to practice them out loud in conversations while you help the family to prepare for the fiesta. Speech recognition technology recognizes your voice and allows you to ask and answer questions in Spanish. And a Spanish dictionary allows you to revisit, repeat and practice each phrase in your own time.\n\nAs you explore the hacienda, you might help Karla, the avid-collector, cook something for the fiesta; or pick out a party outfit for Daniel, the sensitive luchador, to wear. If Maria, the hacienda’s caretaker, doesn’t end the night in a puddle of her own tears, then you’ll know the party preparation was a great success!",
