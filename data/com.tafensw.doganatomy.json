In this initial release, two mammals will be included, a dog and a bison/buffalo.\n\nThe experience also features an interactive quiz, which assesses the playerâ€™s knowledge of the anatomy of said animal. Players are given feedback on the quiz in real-time and can learn through repetition as the questions in the quiz randomize each time it is taken. ",
