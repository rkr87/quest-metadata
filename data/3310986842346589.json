        "description": "Go for a Space Walk and feel the vastness of space with your Oculus Quest.\n\nThree adventure levels:\n\nThe Earth: Exit the space shuttle and chill out, orbiting over any part of The Earth. Set the time-of-day to view sunrises and night lights. Complete challenges to recover satellites to the space shuttle.\n\nSave The World! An asteroid is heading towards Earth. Navigate through the asteroid's tunnels to plant explosives and destroy it in a race against time. 15 levels with 3 levels of difficulty.\n\nThe Space Station: Float around the outside of the Space Station and view the fully working Canadarm remote arm and visiting HTV supply vessels. Complete a puzzle fixing solar panels - randomly different puzzle every time.\n\nNot everyone is cut out to be an astronaut so if you suffer motion sickness in VR,  this app probably isn't for you. Turning off Earth position animations, using the trigger button to thrust in the direction you are looking and making slow turns will all help.",
