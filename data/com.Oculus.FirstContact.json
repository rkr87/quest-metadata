        "description": "First Contact is an official Oculus experience built for Oculus Quest. Experience the magic of ‘presence’ in VR, exploring moments that feel as real as they are fantastically impossible. We've built a magic box full of toys and a robot guide; make a new friend, then touch, tap, bounce, hold and throw things, and play together. \n\nOculus Rex designed First Contact, and is the team that brought you Dreamdeck, Farlands, Prologue and the original Toybox demo. We drew from the inspiration of the 80s: A magical decade when computers and game consoles moved from science fiction to household items and everything seemed possible.\n\n(And we wanted to show everyone where the save icon came from!)\n\nSpecial thanks to Fun Bits Interactive for porting this experience to Oculus Quest!",
