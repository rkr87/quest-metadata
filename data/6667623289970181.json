        "description": "So, you've got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism? \n\nFancy getting your digital head messed with in an uncanny world where logic is king and folly is your only solace? Well, dear misfit, step right up to Poly Ego.\n\nIn the infinite space, you become an unsuspecting lab rat - well, lab robot, to be more precise. Thrust into a reality that teeters between \"oh, that's clever\" and \"why the hell am I doing this?\", you must navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles, all while a robot named Bluepy keeps you company - and sometimes drives you mad.\n\nThe puzzles aren't all just pick-up sticks. Expect to be reflecting lasers like an unpaid intern at a futuristic hair removal salon. Enemy robots swarm the place too, but don't worry – you can handle them, hopefully…\n\nCoordination is key here. You and Bluepy must operate in perfect unison, like a finely tuned orchestra. About the lasers, pressure plates, moving platforms, elevators, and a myriad of other bits that you’ll find along the way, it's your job to figure out their purposes.\n\nOh, and don't forget the cubes. Ah, the cubes! These little blocks are your only hope for salvation. Place them with the precision of a surgeon and the strategic foresight of a chess grandmaster, or spend eternity in the playground.\n\nIf you love the sensation of feeling simultaneously overjoyed and overwhelmingly frustrated, welcome aboard.\n\nAre you ready for Poly Ego?",
