        "description": "Situated on the 4th floor of a fictitious building, OneLab VR encompasses a 50,000 square foot facility that is focused on clinical and public health laboratory training. OneLab VR includes 12 different laboratories, and over 100 (and counting) laboratory-specific pieces of hardware and equipment. \n\nWorking extensively with laboratory architects, designers, safety experts, and members of the laboratory community, we created this virtual training space for your training needs. Everything from the physical size and placement of laboratory environments to simple things like placement of fire alarms and sprinkler systems has been rigorously researched, tested, and reviewed for users like you. \n\nCDC will be releasing quarterly updates to OneLab VR featuring tutorials, additional standalone training, multiplayer scenarios, and accessibility tools. As the need grows and new training programs are developed, CDC will provide training materials and guidance that will allow individuals to create their own training in the OneLab VR environment.",
