        "description": "Situated on the 4th floor of a fictitious building, OneLab VR encompasses a 50,000 square foot facility that is focused on clinical and public health laboratory training. OneLab VR includes 12 different laboratories, over 100 (and counting) laboratory-specific pieces of equipment, and a variety of accessibility, user customization, and multiplayer tools. \n\nWorking extensively with laboratory architects, designers, safety experts, and members of the laboratory community, we created this virtual training space for your training needs. Everything from the physical size and placement of laboratory environments to simple things like placement of fire alarms and sprinkler systems has been rigorously researched, tested, and reviewed for users like you.  \n\nCDC will be releasing quarterly updates to OneLab VR featuring tutorials, additional standalone training, multiplayer scenarios, and accessibility tools. Currently, OneLab VR offers a tutorial scenario where learners new to VR will experience the basics of navigating through the laboratory environment, a packing and shipping scenario that focuses on properly packaging a specimen for shipment via air, and a centrifuge scenario that focuses on loading and operating a microfuge and high-speed bucket centrifuge.
