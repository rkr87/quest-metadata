        "description": "Premortal VR is an exploration and survival game for singleplayer set in a procedurally-generated world. Survive and explore the vast unique world. Gather valuable resources. Craft mighty weapons and armor. Sculpt the landscape as you see fit. Build villages and castles. Prepare well for your trials and ascend beyond!\n\nEvery new world is uniquely generated for the player. The terrain system makes sure there is complete variety in the generated foliage, structures, animals, and items. The ground itself can be terraformed using a shovel.\n\nThe world is filled with usable resources like stone, wood, potatoes, copper and so much more! The player has a few stats like health and stamina which can be increased by the various food in the game. Some of the food can be cooked for bonus stats.\n\nThe game features a crafting system that resembles real-world crafting techniques. Armor can be made using the sewing system. And metal weapons can be forged on the anvil using a smithing mechanic.\n\nPlayers can build structures by accessing their handbook and selecting their desired unlocked build. Each build requires building materials that can be gathered from the world. Some builds have additional effects. For example, the bed allows the player to sleep and skip the night.\n\nThere are powerful bosses that can be challenged. After every boss is defeated, the premortal has passed their trials and can ascend.",
