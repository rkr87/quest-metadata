        "description": "The smooth drum roller's purpose is to flatten and smooth out uneven surfaces, making them beneficial across industries. It uses vibration, static pressure, and impact to compact materials like sand, gravel, and other aggregate materials, making it perfect for rolling weaker aggregates and compacting asphalt pavements. Smooth drum rollers consist of a large, smooth steel drum in the front, two wheels on the rear end, and a cab where the operator can adjust settings based on the specific project. As part of this engaging simulation, participants will operate a smooth drum roller and complete various tasks on an active worksite. \n\nOverview & Activities: \nParticipants begin with an overview that provides context and helps identify key parts and components outside and inside the vehicle, safety tips, and the basics of a walk-around inspection performed before using any heavy machinery. Participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to reinforce essential controls and their location inside the vehicle. \n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn, and practice operating a backhoe in a safe and realistic format. Before starting their simulation tasks, participants must wear personal protective equipment (PPE), conduct a pre-operation inspection of the vehicle, and complete one task to familiarize themselves with the operation of the vehicle.",
