Team up with players and fight intense coop battles in over 50 missions, contracts and assaults, against ever more challenging opponents. \n\nCompete against other players in an exhilarating race to determine who among you is the fastest, and battle in an 8-player death match to determine who is the top ace. \n\nEach successful mission will increase your level and skill, preparing you for the next fight. Starting out as a fighter, you will customize your ship to your liking by mounting equipment obtained through in-game loot drops, as well as by selecting upgrades in exchange for obtained resources. Or switch ship classes and get yourself a tank or engineer ship, each with specialized weaponry, unique special abilities, and a variety of skins, which allow you and your party to be better equipped to take on each new challenge.",

                "change_log": "Version 1.2 \n\nNew features:\n\nNew control schemes for the Gear VR, Oculus Go and Oculus Rift have been added depending on the available controllers. In the Cockpit Menu -> Control Options there are now three new options: \"Head for Flight\", \"Gaze to Turn\" and \"Remote Controller for Flight\". These control schemes have their own comfort values (\"comfortable\", \"moderate\" or \"intense\").\n- The first control scheme \"Head for Flight\" is the default one in Anshar Online. It has two options: \"Tunnel Vision\", to enable/disable the visual effect that darkens the view when the ship quickly turns and that it reduces motion sickness, and \"Turning with Oculus Go/Gear Vr controller\" to allow to quick turn in Oculus GO or Gear VR by clicking on the left and right side of the remote controller' s touchpad to turn left or right.\n- The second control scheme is \"Gaze to turn\" to control the ship by looking in the direction the player wants to fly. In that case the ship continues to steer in that direction until looking forward. This control scheme has three options: \"Turning Gaze Sensitivity\" to change how much the player has to move the gaze before starting a turn, \"Tunnel Vision\" and \"Turning with Oculus Go/Gear Vr controller\", as described before for the control scheme \"Head for Flight\".\n- The third control scheme is \"Remote Controller (Gear VR controller, Oculus Go controller, Oculus Touch, Oculus Gamepad) for Flight\". Using this control scheme the ship is free to rotate in three dimensions: yaw, pitch and roll (the last option is not available for Oculus Go and Gear VR). The options \"Yaw Sensitivity\", \"Pitch Sensitivity\" and \"Roll Sensitivity\" allow to change the related angle sensitivity. Another option is \"Yaw/Pitch/Roll Deadzone\" to change how much the player has to move the controller before getting a response. The option “Inverted Pitch” allows to invert the pitch axis of the remote controller.\n\nFixes:\n- Fixed an issue where a user will remain on a black screen without a prompt until reconnecting if internet connection is lost before ‘Confirming’ a mission \n- Fixed an issue where in some missions, the 'cooldown' bar will temporarily appear grayed out when special abilities are re-activated\n- Fixed an issue where application exit can be accidentally triggered\n- Fixed an issue where Written messages in the chat box are hidden after closing the chat\n- Fixed an issue where the text in the menu prompts the user to plug in headphones to use VoIP\n- Fixed an issue where VoIP instructions are missing words when observed in the Menus screen throughout the title\n- Fixed an issue where frequently, the Boost Power Up icon remains on-screen after spamming the secondary weapon button where 3 Power ups are in line \n- Fixed an issue where opening the Radial Menu while Using the Snap Turn makes the Radial Menu lock persist for one Snap Turn \n- Fixed an issue where no credits rewarded after completing a PVP match with 7 or more players \n- Fixed an issue where SFX is played during HUD tutorial while all sound settings are set to mute\n- Fixed an issue where 'Items Bag Full' message stays on screen if the user dies soon after collecting an item with a full bag\n- Fixed an issue where enemy lock-on audio cue triggers when an ally fires Healing Orb at User "
