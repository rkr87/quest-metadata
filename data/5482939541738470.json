        "description": "Climb aboard the historic HMVS Cerberus and travel through time alongside the Cerberus crew, as you stand in the shoes of a stoker, a helmsman, a gunner and finally don the gold-laced cap of Executive Officer.\n\nCerberus was the first British warship to be powered purely by steam and is the only remaining breastwork monitor class warship left in the world. She is now being used as a breakwater at Half Moon Bay (Melbourne, Australia), settling lower each year beneath the waters.\n\nThis significant piece of Australian naval history has been digitally revived in all her glory, welcoming you to experience life as part of the Victorian Navy.\n\nFrom Cerberus’ maiden journey to the war scare of 1888, you’ll grow with and develop a sense of camaraderie toward your fellow crewmen. These include friendly new faces, as well as revered historical figures, such as Fleet Engineer James Breaks and Captain Alan B Thomas.\n\nThe bugle is calling and it’s time to raise steam. All aboard!",
