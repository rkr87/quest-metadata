        "description": "Take the helicopter and fly over the shiny illuminated famous Strip with its hotels and attractions.\nNice VR experience and beautiful memories if you already were there or if not, gain experience as if you are there.\nYou get the impression to really be over Las Vegas.\nTake that crazy 360 degree real helicopter flight over Vegas by night without leaving your home, even without leaving your couch!\nYou can look in all directions during the flight. Turn your head, look up and down outside of the helicopter.  \n\nYou have never seen this before. \nThis is the ultimate VR Experience ... frameless. \n\nFlight time: 14 minutes.\n\nYou fly an extraordinary route, directly over the Strip and over the hotel skyscrapers. The normal tourist sightseeing flight routes are always far from the Strip and cost many times more than that great app-flight experience. The normal tourist helicopter you can see on the horizon. If you have made such a tourist flight Las Vegas once, test the difference here.\n\n",
