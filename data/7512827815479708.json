        "description": "Welcome to The Link Facility.\n\nThe facility was established after Dr. Sam Summer discovered a mysterious portal deep within a cavern. Years of research led to the expansion of the facility into what you see today.\n\nWe have developed a method to open and activate the portal using unique creatures we've collected, known as \"Reds.\" We've successfully captured two of these Reds, which assist us in controlling the Link, enabling travel in and out of the portal. Our ultimate goal is to control the Reds remotely, eliminating the need for human explorers like yourself.\n\nAs a scientist at the facility, your mission is to enter the portal, now known as The Link, and gather valuable data. Each expedition into The Link presents a new and unpredictable environment, beyond our control.\n\nWithin The Link, your primary objective is to find the exit, marked by blue domes we call \"Links.\" This otherworldly realm is a dark void, but you will be equipped with a scanner to navigate and locate the exit.\n\nBe cautious of the Reds within The Link. Contact with them will reset your journey and expel you from the portal. They are not friendly.\n\nThere have been reports of missing children of the facilityâ€™s scientists, raising concerns that The Link may be responsible. Additionally, we've encountered anomalies within The Link. Something is happening, and we must understand the consequences of our actions.\n\nGood luck, and stay vigilant.",
