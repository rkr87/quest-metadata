        "description": "Revria is a single-player immersive simulation of life in an open, living star system. Lovingly crafted just for Quest, with a focus on realistic physics and interaction.\n\n• Experience action and adventure in an open star-system that's been hand-crafted for Quest.\n• Choose your own path on foot and in your ship - or someone else's if you're into the grand-theft thing.\n• Fly your way, using thumb-sticks and/or virtual controls, along with other custom settings.\n• Earn credits through holo-apps for making deliveries and bounty hunting (More apps/jobs coming in updates!)\n• Spend those hard-earned credits at FlyAway!\n• Discover intriguing structures and artifacts as you learn about the technologies of unknown origin in this system.\n• Tormenting the police robots is dangerous fun. They'll just make more.\n• Or maybe you'd rather take a walk on the beach, and listen to some music?\n\n(EARLY ACCESS: This game is still in development and will receive frequent updates.

More soon!\n\n-Fixed NPC's spawning without enviro-suits and suffocating on Tiovus, Seftos, and Aiduq (thank you, Discord peoples!)\n\n-Added new setting “On-Foot Movement Style”  for optional linear thumb-stick movement. (That-is moving without acceleration/inertia.) Disabled by default since it’s still not ideal with everything else being physics/force-based. Only real issue is linear mode causes occasional stuttering with your hands/body when running.  The existing force-based mode is still the default, but a lot of users find it too 'floaty' so I added this new mode/setting.\n\n-Thought of a better way to render 3D clouds on Quest (seen on planets Revria and Zakazi). Still some artifacts, and not a true volumetric effect, but you can fly above/below/through them which is my main requirement. I'll be able to improve on these, plus they're GPU-friendly and look more natural than the old, blobby clouds.\n\n-Changes to terrain textures on Revria\n\n-Increase Stunner battery consumption for better weapon-balance (only three shots to drain clip)\n\n-Changed dashboard text font (still finding what looks right stylistically and is also legible)\n\n-Fix: Starting sun position now randomized each time you jump to a planet. This was actually a bug I didn't realize I've had since AppLab release. When I added the starting time-of-day menu option, I broke the randomized sun angles that I had before. (*This is only a placeholder for the true time/orbit system.)\n\nNEXT UPDATE: Finally add control diagram/layout, and some improvements to deliveries and bounty hunting."

Haven’t been able to recreate the bug myself, unfortunately, so I made a change to code where the conditions that led to the behavior should be impossible. When you fix a bug that way, the behavior usually just changes. So we have to keep chasing it! Let me know if you see any new strangeness with the replicators."

Steps required for AppLab submission. This means you will need to uninstall Revria before installing the new version. This unfortunately will clear your settings, credits, and fines since I'm using Unity's built-in PlayerPrefs to save data for now. \n\n-Changing to ARM64 was a huge performance boost! Quest 2 now has two quick graphical improvements as a result:\n\n-Quest 2: Realtime shadows!\n\nQuest 2: Accent/point lights apply to all objects instead of just static/world objects.\n\n-Navigation-graph for AI is now pre-generated and included in the build, instead of regenerating it every time a scene/planet loads. Operations related to LOD grouping and static colliders were similarly removed from scene-load process.\n\n-Added effect over windshield w/ blue light during Drum/jump-gate transit. (Was previously full view fade-to-black) Scenes/planets now load asynchronously in an attempt to maintain fluid camera movement during scene-load. Still one spot where it’s freezing in the load/init process, despite the efforts mentioned in the previous item. Will smooth it out if I can determine what step is making the GPU/CPU hang. Grumble.\n\n-A few NPC/background-sim performance optimizations.\n\n-Replaced some plants/trees on Revria with the transparent/cutout ones I was using previously (seen in announcement teaser from January). Also finally found a suitable Unity shader for cutouts to avoid pixellated edges on Quest. (Legacy>Transparent>Cutout>VertexLit)\n\n-Swapped some terrain textures on Revria. Felt it looked a bit cartoony with too much green everywhere. I only get four terrain textures per planet, so it's tough making decisions. It’ll probably take a while to land on my final choices for all planets.\n\n-Disabled particle/volumetric clouds on Seftos. Most likely neither Aiduq nor Seftos will be able to have volumetric clouds. Too much transparency has a heavy performance-cost and leads to more stuttering than I can abide.\n\n-Fixed positioning of Faders and Screen inside Optera Duo\n\n-Fixed some task-target pointers on HoloTracker not getting deactivated when they should\n\n-Added menu interaction audio with placeholder sounds\n"
