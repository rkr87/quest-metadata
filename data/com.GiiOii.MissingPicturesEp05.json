        "description": "Envisioned after her 2015 film \"Sweet Bean\", \"Oh Debu\" tells the story of Aya, a young woman full of complexes about her body.\nThrough this story, Naomi Kawase wanted to give herself a challenge trying to make a comedy, far from her naturalist, poetic previous work.\n\nMISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films.  Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made. \n\nA series directed by Clément Deneux from an original idea by Joseph Beauregard.\n\nCoproduced by Atlas V, ARTE France, BBC, PTS, Serendipity Films, Wild Fang Films, Giioii.\n\nWith the support from CNC, Pictanovo, Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Procirep-Angoa, TAICCA, Film Fund Luxembourg, RAPA and Ministry of Science and ICT (Republic of Korea).",
