        "description": "For patients confined to healthcare facilities, maintaining a sense of connection to the outside world is crucial for their well-being.\n\nINTERACT – GAMIFIED INTERACTIONS FOR PATIENTS\nGamified interventions designed to help with distraction and mild interactive and physical activities designed to be simple and can be used controller free, so patients are able to use them with ease sitting down, standing or in confined areas. \n\nWe keep adding to our Interact library so that patients can continually use features such as painting, word search or work on their hoops, darts or slingshot skills We also have mild physical activities such as music boxing and interacting with objects in VR space helping with their dexterity and motor skills. These activities are calming, relaxing and joyful. \n\nSCENES – IMMERSIVE 360º LIBRARY\nFrom the Great Barrier Reef to Bondi Beach, to walking in Seville to playing or witnessing the mesmerising Dubai skyline at night, our library offers a wide range of 360º experiences. Includes access to our expanding 360º photo and video library, which enables patients to explore diverse locations.\n\nACCESSIBLITY\nActivities can be used controller-free, with either one or both hands and some of them just require head-tracking. A design ensuring that even patients with limited mobility can benefit and engage with PatientVR maximising its usability.\n\nThe primary goal is to bring joy and comfort to patients, contributing to their overall recovery, emotional and overall well-being.\n",
