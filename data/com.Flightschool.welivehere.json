        "description": "Rockey lives in a tent in a park. We meet her on the day police and sanitation workers come to clear the park of the homeless people seeking shelter there. Rockey flees, unable to salvage her personal belongings. \nThrough interactivity, explore Rockey’s personal objects, objects that hold Rockey’s memories and illustrate her past. Pick up her journal to reveal an animated poem, the story of the first homeless man Rockey saw when she was ten. Find a small wooden box filled with Rockey’s photos. Wind up a music box to hear Rockey’s dream of having a home again. Pick up a small cut out of a motorcycle and open up a psychedelic animation telling the story of the day Rockey got married on the back of a motorcycle on her way to Sturges. Finally, a novel from Rockey’s childhood opens to reveal an animation of Rockey’s last desire - to be a cowboy. ",
