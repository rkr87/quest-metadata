        "description": "In the world of Stilt, you are a furball with two arms. You were routinely flying your spaceship delivering gift packages until a giant octopus living atop a volcano decided to steal your spaceship, dispersing the precious cargo all over the hills. You equip yourself with a springy stilt in each hand to bounce through the challenging landscape to retrieve the lost gifts and eventually get back your stolen spaceship!\n\nStilt is a colorful, stunning VR platformer game that takes inspiration from classic platformers. Use your quick reflexes and problem-solving skills to progress through the levels, collecting lost gift packages and stamps along the way. With your wits and stilts, you can pass chasms, avoid traps, break things and smack creatures. Find power-ups to upgrade your stilts and become the ultimate stilt master!\n\nTake part in several modes in various PvP arenas in cross-platform multiplayer! In Smack-em-all!, score points by smacking other players to sea. In Area Bash, gain points by staying inside a marked, constantly moving area while trying to keep other players outside. Try not to get zapped in Electric Tag, and pop the most balloons to win in Balloon Hunt. There is also a huge lobby area where you can meet up with other players and prepare your stilts for the next match.\n\nAre you ready to jump around like never before? Put on your headset, fasten your stilts, and have some bouncy adventures in the world of Stilt!\n\nJoin Stilt Discord https://discord.gg/mYy9Z8axEm",
