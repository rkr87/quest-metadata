        "description": "Visit Chernobyl without leaving home!\n\nChernobyl VR Project combines video game mechanics with the educational and movie narrative approach. \n\nIt is the very first virtual tour around the Chernobyl area. Chernobyl VR Project uses a state-of-the-art graphics solutions, such as advanced 3D scans of locations and buildings, spherical photography, stereoscopic videos and augmented reality. \n\nChernobyl VR Project is not only a story of an abandoned place, but it is even more about the people. The Farm 51 aimed to reach survivors for whom the disaster had an intimate and sometimes family aspect.\n\nThe Farm 51 is donating part of the proceeds from the sales of the Chernobyl VR Project to foundations helping the victims of the disaster in Ukraine. In doing so we hope that we contribute this cause and that the initiative will give our project another social dimension.",
