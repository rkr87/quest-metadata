        "description": "Living in Sim is a virtual reality-bending trip to a post-party, drug-fuelled argument about whether the world is a simulation.\n\nThis choose-your-own psychedelic adventure will make you question reality, trip balls, and laugh at the absurdities that occur in a messy London flat. \n\nExperience life through Ed’s perspective and see how his motionless body is cared for by his miscreant flatmates, while his mind is busy exploring other worlds.\n\nAnd you’ll be left wondering: Am I Living in Sim!?\n\nIf you're expecting a 2 hour game for yourself, this probably isn't for you. Please don't buy it! If you want a trippy 40 minute interactive 360 3D video experience then this is the one. \n\nWARNING: Living in Sim contains drug use, violence and strong language. Some scenes include flashing images that may cause discomfort or trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. User discretion is advised.\n",
