Additionally, the whole experience changes to revolve around those objects. Put your hand in the shredder and see for yourself!\n\n- Settings Menu: Added a menu that includes controls information.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Shredding Physics Enhancement: Enhanced the overall shredding physics to make the experience more realistic and satisfying.\n\n- Improved Look: Changed the walls texture to a white finish with ambient occlusion, giving the environment a more polished look. We also made the paper shredder more eye-catching.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n- File size optimisation: We reduced the game's overall size and decreased loading times, resulting in a smoother experience.\n\n- Annoying Phone Ringing Sound: Fixed the issue where phones would ring continuously. Phones now only ring when they are picked up, preventing them from annoying the player.\n\n- No More Object Teleportation to the Shredder: Removed the bug where objects were being teleported into the plastic shredder upon collision, ensuring objects behave as expected.\n\n"
