        "description": "Channel Player has two scenes.\n\n- Playback title selection screen at Spacecraft theater.\nDisplay other titles with the left and right sticks and triggers. In the case of a folder or comic book (zip, cbz) where only still images are saved, they will be displayed in the same way as the folder where videos are saved. No need to sort the contents by name or by time, they will be listed in advance. It also has a favorite, history function, and unplayed title display function.\n\n- During playback at outer space.\nYou can intuitively adjust the movement of the camera viewpoint during video playback with the left and right sticks. The AB button is used to start and end playback, and the trigger is to change the playback position, so it can be operated with a single action. You don't have to point the laser at a small button on the screen to operate the app. During video playback, there is a direct jump and a setting option that allows you to move the camera only during pauses.",

Also added a play icon display when playback starts\n\n    When displaying a still image, if the page could not be turned any more, the page was displayed again, but it was canceled and the prohibition icon was displayed\n\n    Expanded aspect ratio settings when playing 2D video files.\n    Previously it was a toggle between 16:9 and 4:3, but now Auto (the size of the video file itself) and aspect ratios 16:16, 2.35:1, 9:16 have been added\n    When changing the 2D aspect ratio and rotating, it is now remembered by file instead of by folder.\n    It does not work with WebDAV, but if there is Setting_Separate.txt (file size is arbitrary) for each folder, if the settings are not saved, the aspect ratio will be Auto and there will be no rotation. If there is no Setting_Separate.txt, it follows the settings of the video played immediately before. If you put video files with different aspect ratios and rotation positions in the same folder, it is better to put Setting_Separate.txt.\n\n- Bug fixes\n    Fixed a bug that caused the camera to move slightly when starting to move\n    Fixed the problem of clicking when opening the WebDAV settings dialog\n    There were cases where afterimages remained during direct jumps, so the video was muted.\n\n- Specification changes specific to the Quest version\n   Changed from Gumma to Lear\n    SciFi theater screen brightened\n   As a result, the default brightness was made the same as the SteamVR version.\n\n   Android API level changed to minimum 25, target 27\n   Oculus Integration v20.1(1.52.1) changed to v29(1.61.0)\n   Color Gamut has been changed from Quest to Rec. 2020 for Quest 2."
