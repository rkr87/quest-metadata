        "description": "Channel Player has two scenes.\n\n- Playback title selection screen at Spacecraft theater.\nDisplay other titles with the left and right sticks and triggers. In the case of a folder or comic book (zip, cbz) where only still images are saved, they will be displayed in the same way as the folder where videos are saved. No need to sort the contents by name or by time, they will be listed in advance. It also has a favorite, history function, and unplayed title display function.\n\n- During playback at outer space.\nYou can intuitively adjust the movement of the camera viewpoint during video playback with the left and right sticks. The AB button is used to start and end playback, and the trigger is to change the playback position, so it can be operated with a single action. You don't have to point the laser at a small button on the screen to operate the app. During video playback, there is a direct jump and a setting option that allows you to move the camera only during pauses.",

Also added a play icon display when playback starts\n\n    When displaying a still image, if the page could not be turned any more, the page was displayed again, but it was canceled and the prohibition icon was displayed\n\n    Expanded aspect ratio settings when playing 2D video files.\n    Previously it was a toggle between 16:9 and 4:3, but now Auto (the size of the video file itself) and aspect ratios 16:16, 2.35:1, 9:16 have been added\n    When changing the 2D aspect ratio and rotating, it is now remembered by file instead of by folder.\n    It does not work with WebDAV, but if there is Setting_Separate.txt (file size is arbitrary) for each folder, if the settings are not saved, the aspect ratio will be Auto and there will be no rotation. If there is no Setting_Separate.txt, it follows the settings of the video played immediately before. If you put video files with different aspect ratios and rotation positions in the same folder, it is better to put Setting_Separate.txt.\n\n- Bug fixes\n    Fixed a bug that caused the camera to move slightly when starting to move\n    Fixed the problem of clicking when opening the WebDAV settings dialog\n    There were cases where afterimages remained during direct jumps, so the video was muted.\n\n- Specification changes specific to the Quest version\n   Changed from Gumma to Lear\n    SciFi theater screen brightened\n   As a result, the default brightness was made the same as the SteamVR version.\n\n   Android API level changed to minimum 25, target 27\n   Oculus Integration v20.1(1.52.1) changed to v29(1.61.0)\n   Color Gamut has been changed from Quest to Rec. 2020 for Quest 2."

However, the load was so heavy that it caused the video playback to pause, so the settings are no longer saved, and the settings are saved only when the playback ends.\n - Garbage collection was occurring in string processing when title information was displayed repeatedly during playback, but string processing has been optimized to reduce the frequency of garbage collection.\n\n2021-04-18 1.23\nAdded functions\n  - When displaying a still image or a comic book, the first page and the last page are displayed when the stick is moved up or down, but if the stick is moved back down or up immediately, it will return to the previous page because of the possibility of accidental operation.\n  - You can now use the Y button to open the direct jump dialog when displaying still images or comic books. You can jump directly to the page.\n  - In the title selection screen, when the search button is clicked from the settings dialog, the folder name of the title can be extracted as a keyword for search operation.\n  - When you click the search button on the title selection screen, the folder name of the title can be extracted as a keyword.\n\nSpecification changes\n  - Changed the color of the progress bar of the title information display during playback from red to blue.\n  - In 1.22, the title information display was only displayed on the right side of the screen, but it has been changed to the left side in the SteamVR version. In 1.22, the title information was displayed only on the right side of the screen.\n  - Direct jump dialog now closes immediately when playback starts.\n  - When the Direct Jump dialog is opened, the position of the user operation bar on the button of the currently playing file is now set to the time position when it is opened.\n  - Adjusted the trigger response for WebDAV address input.\n\nBug fixes\n  - When using the trigger instead of the A button when starting playback by selecting each file in the property dialog, seek was generated and the problem of playback from the wrong position was fixed.\n  - The problem of seeking has been fixed when using the trigger to start playback from the title selection screen when the start playback by trigger is enabled in the same way as above.\n"
