        "description": "The skid steer loader is a highly versatile vehicle commonly used in construction, manufacturing, and engineering projects. Its compact size, powerful engine, and wide range of attachments for lifting, digging, and moving earth make it a popular choice among workers on the job site. Participants will operate a skid steer to complete various tasks on an active worksite as part of the engaging simulation.\n\nOverview & Activities:\nParticipants begin with an overview that provides context and helps identify key parts and components outside and inside the vehicle, safety tips, and the basics of a walk-around inspection performed before using any heavy machinery. Then, participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to reinforce which central controls and steps are required to start the vehicle. Next, they are asked to perform a task to familiarize themselves with operating the vehicle in a VR environment. Embedded learning outcomes based on Bloomâ€™s revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying.\n\nParticipant Simulation:\nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn, and practice operating a skid-steer in a safe and realistic format. Before beginning their tasks, participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct a walk-around inspection of the vehicle. Finally, participants are challenged to complete a series of tasks at an active worksite. ",
