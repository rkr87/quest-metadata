        "description": "CoSpaces Edu is an educational platform enabling students in any grade level or subject to build virtual creations, animate them with code, explore and share them in fun innovative ways including immersive VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality).\n\nStudents become creators of their own content and develop 21st Century learning skills such as collaboration, critical thinking and coding, while connecting with the learning material at the same time.\nEducators can also design their own interactive lessons or virtual field trips to provide students with original and engaging learning experiences that captivate and last.\n\nDesigned with a user-friendly interface making it intuitive to create with, CoSpaces Edu can be easily implemented and introduced. Only a few clicks are enough to build a first CoSpace and get started. Various resources including teacher guides, lesson plans and student check lists are available for free on cospaces.io/edu.\n\nPlease note that while the CoSpaces Edu platform is recommended to users (including kids of all ages), the CoSpaces Edu Meta app is only recommended to kids 13 and above.",
