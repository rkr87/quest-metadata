This 14.5-minute ride can be relished as a single-rider or shared as a multi-rider journey with friends and loved ones, adding an unexpectedly magical touch. Your pass will also automatically unlock Acts 2 and 3 upon their release, along with a sneak peek of the highly anticipated 'The Haunted Castle.'\n\nDrawing inspiration from the best dark rides in premier Theme Parks, 'Into the Metaverse' is a slow-moving, narrated experience showcasing animated scenes that explore humanity's quest for immersive experiences. Beloved by young and old, gamers and non-gamers alike, this ride is just the beginning and will leave you craving more. Once all Acts are unveiled, it will stand as the longest, most ambitious dark ride to date. In fact, Act 1 alone already rivals some of the biggest rides ever.\n\nFor a preview of the expansive magic being imagineered, wander through the Core Plaza and discover the burgeoning world that lies ahead.
