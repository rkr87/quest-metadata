        "description": "Tsai Ming-Liang is haunted by his childhood memories, memories so vivid they've been impossible to translate into film. In this episode, he shows us why this is the case, in a moving tribute to his grandparents who took him to see two movies every night.\n\nMISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films.  Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made. \n\nA series directed by Clément Deneux from an original idea by Joseph Beauregard.\nEpisode codirected with Kuan-Yuan Lai.\n\nCoproduced by Atlas V, ARTE France, BBC, PTS, Serendipity Films, Wild Fang Films, Giioii.\n\nWith the support from CNC, Pictanovo, Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Procirep-Angoa, TAICCA, Film Fund Luxembourg, RAPA and Ministry of Science and ICT (Republic of Korea).",
