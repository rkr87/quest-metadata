        "description": "Journey into the microverse with 10k Science. From discovering a CRISPR treatment for sickle cell disease to investigating the microscopic insect anatomy of an invasive species, 10k Science seamlessly adapts to diverse educational uses with its advanced, intuitive technology and state-of-the-art instructional design.\n\nAccording to Dynamoid CEO, Laura Lynn Gonzalez, \"What 10k Science represents is a breakthrough in the way we teach science – it's an automated Magic School Bus for any education level. Students today are distracted and falling behind, and now more than ever educators need help providing even a barebones education, let alone a world-class education tailored to every student's ability, across every demographic.\" \n\nAn AI-powered teacher’s assistant guides students with live audio interactions and responds verbally, in real-time. Designed to help teachers evaluate student learning and provide critical feedback, the web-based dashboard monitors student progression and gives insight into the student thought process. Future enhancement aims to empower parents with greater control over usage, potentially rewarding students with additional VR screen time as they progress through their lessons. 10k Science features a growing library of inquiry-driven content from researchers at Cambridge, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and others, with alignment to the Next Generation Science Standards by Lawrence Hall of Science, 10k Science represents the future of science education. \n",
