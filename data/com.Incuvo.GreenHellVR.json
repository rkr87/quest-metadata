        "description": "Follow the story of Jake Higgins, a famous anthropologist, who is thrown deep into the emerald and impenetrable Amazonian rain forest - the green hell. What you discover there will be worse than what you have ever fought against to survive. Find yourself stranded in this  dangerous jungle, surrounded by predators with only a trusty smartwatch, backpack, and a survival guide to help you stay alive. \n\nGreen Hell VR now also includes the Spirits of Amazonia Update - a prequel which presents the adventures of Jake set before the events of the original Green Hell. \nYour main goal will be to gain the trust of the Mu'agi tribe, along with the chief of the native Amazonian village. To accomplish this, you will need to complete missions relating to the local legends, to help out tribe members, and to provide supplies for the village, all rebuilt and tailored for the VR platform.\n\nHighlights:\n- The first part of a new prequel trilogy story set before the events of the original game\n- 10-15 hours of new content - the in-game area is DOUBLED in comparison to the base game\n- Brand new activities, such as  helping out the local population\n- Discover new tribal villages and challenging Tribal Legends\n",
