Introduced a Hub Menu Selection Highlighter feature to show what and which settings are currently selected and in use.\n\n1.3. Redesigned the Hub Menu Layout to allow the Vignette Feature and all Comfort Settings to be easily and intuitively customized efficiently.\n\n2. The Street View Loading Screen is now Transparent! This allows viewing the 3D environment while waiting 1-2 seconds for each new panorama to load.\n\n2.2. Street View Loading Screen is now High Resolution and has a different design!\n\n3. Flight Boost Trigger Buttons are now Pressure Sensitive (More Pressure = More Boost) and can now be used at the same time to accumulate double boost!\n\n4. AI now has a Sound Effect to notify the user when the Microphone starts recording your voice.\n\n5. Updated Hub \"EarthQuest\" Title Model and Texture.\n\n6. Renamed the \"VR Background\" Feature to \"AR Background.\"\n\nThis is a BIG one! Please let me know ASAP if something doesn't work as expected. I tested everything as much as I could."

The Controller ‚ÄòMenu‚Äô button and Hand Tracking ‚ÄòPinch to open Menu‚Äô gesture are now both connected to the EarthQuest menu ! - You‚Äôll now have an easier, more efficient & intuitive alternative way of Opening / Closing the Menu !\n\n3. A more concise Hub Menu button layout ( multiplayer section )\n\n3.2. Changed the Multiplayer Button in the Hub for choosing a Room Name from \"Type Room Code\" to \"Type Room Name\" to avoid confusion and for consistency\n\n4. Fixed distance from sea level in meters *glitching out* when going over 9999999m\n\n5. Modified the terrain allocated memory very slightly to potentially completely solve the ' out of memory ' system crash that's happening extremely rarely due to some OS inconsistency.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mpxN1LxR4KI"
