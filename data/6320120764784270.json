The processing used for the morning light effects were implemented to render them at half the normal resolution, now everything is running at** MAXIMUM RESOLUTION**, **INCLUDING ALL THE OTHER LIGHTING EFFECTS !!!**\n**5.** Reverted a very small color change in the Middle of Day Light inside of Immersive Sky Mode.  (less yellow) Thanks to @thunderella for the suggestion :heart_2_EQ: \n**6.** Fixed the empty space at the start of some AI Messages.\n**7.** Fixed the music volume not going back to normal volume after a rare scenario where the AI Companion fulfills a teleportation request without providing a message."
