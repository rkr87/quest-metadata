Realistic Sun, Sunrises, and Sunsets !!!\n\n- The sun has been completely revamped for realism !\n- Sunsets and Sunrises have been overhauled for realism as well, based on real life visuals !\n- The sun will now also get occluded by the clouds, just like in real life !\n\n2. More Quality and Performance feedback to help the user more easily achieve their preferred experience\n\n3. Fixed a Street View problem that turned the Mixed Reality view to black while previously using it"

EVERYONE will now receive DOUBLE the amount of Tokens every few hours !!\n\nNote: the Tokens amount is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, but may still very slightly change in the future ( less or more ) depending on traffic"

                "change_log": "v32.00 is LIVE!\n\nFor some of you, this update might just be the BEST update EarthQuest ever got. So, prepare!\n\n1. Every single flight functionality has been improved, from hand tracking movement to multi-directional flight movement like on the grip & thumbstick flight inputs:\n   - The entire flight system has been reengineered for immersion! The movement should now be much more immersive.\n   - Better rotation integration for thumbstick flight input - built for easy mistake-free control, immersion, and a much smoother integration with the flight movement during combined use.\n   \nFeel free to hop in and see how immersive the new flight movement is!\n\n2. As requested by many of you, you can now navigate a larger distance in Street View at once just by double tapping the right trigger button.\n\n3. Previously switching to Street View during nighttime or morning/sunset would alter its colors to adapt to the environmental light. However, depending on the panorama, this could've easily lowered visibility. This is now fixed.\n\n3.2 The loading time between the panoramas in Street View Continuous Navigation (when holding forward) is now approximately 0.4s faster thanks to the new optimized Street View system.\n\n4. Fixed the issue where the `Return` menu button (the back arrow) wouldn't make a sound when pressed.\n\n5. No more text in the Hub Menu blocking the Earth view!\n\n5.2 The Hub Menu will now automatically start open after the first time you opened it.\n\n6. An \"illusion\" effect in the Hub Area giving the feeling that the Earth globe clouds appeared underneath the globe's surface has been reported by some of you. The clouds were previously correctly positioned, so the only solution was to slightly increase the distance between the Earth and the clouds, which is what I did in v32. Let me know if the effect is gone or less noticeable!\n\n7. Better 'How to Play' design!\n\n8. Fixed many small bugs and a few that occurred in very specific circumstances.\n\nMany big and small improvements & fixes might have been missed out since they're not 100% worth listing."
