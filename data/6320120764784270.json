        "description": "# EarthQuest - Changelog v12-13\n\nGreetings, fellow explorers!\n\nI, Bowie (also known as Electrum), am thrilled to present a monumental update that embodies 13 days and nights of relentless dedication and hard work. EarthQuest's version 12 and version 13 is more than just an update; it's a testament to what unwavering determination can achieve.\n\n\n### Clearing the Path\n- This update is so substantial that I had to remove previous changelogs from the main page to make space for the sheer magnitude of changes.\n\n### Street View Integration\nI'm thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level.\n\n### Single Player Mode\n- I've implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience.\n- It's optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).\n\n### Hub for Play Modes\n\n- The new UI now includes a hub where you can seamlessly switch between Play Modes, whether you want to explore solo or join others in multiplayer adventures.\n\n### Room Management\n\n- Players can now easily create or join rooms with room codes.\n- Clear error messages guide you when there's no internet, servers are down, or no room code is provided.",

Changes to Settings are Automatically Saved, Ensuring that all SEVEN Customizable Features Retain the State you Selected in your Previous Play Session upon Restarting.\n3. No More Sucky Space > Earth Transitions When you Need to Get Somewhere fast. Now you just type your Location from Space, and EarthQuest flies you there SMOOTHLY!\n4. All Keyboards are now Moved at Chest-Level whenever, wherever you need.\n5. This one i Really Enjoy... Your Multiplayer Friends are NO LONGER Stuttering, not even Slightly. In the previous Version, it looked like your explorer friends moved in your direction for a brief second, even though no one moved at all...\n6. Hand Tracking StreetView Mode NO LONGER Activates Randomly. HOORAY :D\n7. API Key Setup got more Polished, API Keyboard no longer vanishes for eternity, Now, it automatically opens every 3 seconds, So if you accidentally close it, You don't have to Restart.\n7.5?. Added Confirmation Check for Changing the API Key. Now, Before you potentially remove a working key, You have to press Twice for Verification. (Simplistic Text beside the \n button explains exactly this).\n"

Now you don't need to Paste your key in the input field (many people did not know how) if you have the key copied, the key pastes ITSELF in!"

IN JUST 3 DAYS i used 112 USD worth of Google API Services, i knew there were a lot of people using the key, but sadly this meant i had to pay more than a thousand US Dollars at the end of this MONTH, so i had two choices, remove a ton of EarthQuest features and only leave the 3D Tiles, which meant i still had to pay A LOT,\nor - remove all my API Keys from EarthQuest and rework some functionalities so that you can only play EarthQuest after inserting your own API Key. this also meant i had to make an IN-GAME Tutorial and some adjustments.\nso i obviously chose the most logical option (the second one) and did it.\nnow it's 4 AM, you will have to update EarthQuest in order to play since i will delete my API Keys to prevent Google from Charging me 1000 $ overnight :sob:"
