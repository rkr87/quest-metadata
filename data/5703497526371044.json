        "description": "The most obvious solutions are not the way out.\n\nImpossible Doors was designed to get you thinking outside the box in the shortest possible time. Entertain your friends and family as they try to solve puzzles that might look easy at the start but are seemingly impossible to solve. If that doesn't get them, mini-games like basketball, Nerf guns, and paper toss will. If you're expecting a 2-hour solo game, this probably isn't for you. However, if you plan to entertain your friends and family or want to draw a crowd, this is the perfect title.\n\nKey Detective Features:\n\n10 levels of puzzles\nMini-games to earn coins for clues (basketball, paper toss, Nerf guns)\nMore levels coming...\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",
