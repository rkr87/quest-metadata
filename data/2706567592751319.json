Actually, youâ€™ve touched a lot of things that we specifically asked you not to, discovering that what appears to be a simple room with a screen and an enticing red button is actually hiding countless clues, devious puzzles, and insane consequences ranging from ending the world, to taking you back in time.\n\nTo celebrate the gameâ€™s 3rd anniversary, weâ€™ve been working on a big update for the game to address player feedback, improve quality of life, and, in spots, give the game some visual polish. Plus countless bug fixes!\n\nNEW\n* Achievements! We now support Meta Achievements in the game - try and unlock them all!\n* Seated Mode. Players can now play the game seated. Take a load off and relax!\n* Height Adjustment. You can now manually adjust your player height in the game settings.\n* Distance Grab.

A green outline will appear around grabbable objects, making them much easier to find.\n* Teleport UI improvements. Now much easier to see where you can and cannot teleport to.\n* Weâ€™ve enhanced 10 of the gameâ€™s endings to add more visual excitement.\n-- Visual improvements to the creature model in the alien ending.\n* Added haptics to more interactions:\n-- Pushing buttons\n-- Hover over grabbable objects\n-- Grab/release objects\n-- Hit something with the hammer\n-- Write on or erase the whiteboard\n* Fixed missing font characters in Polish and Turkish translations\n* Menu additions/improvements:\n-- Player Height slider\n-- Standing / Seated Mode toggle\n-- Distance Grab toggle\n-- Player Controls Diagram\n-- Improved highlighting in Language selection"

So here are a few things to make intentionally touching what you should not even better:\n\n- Buttons and wheels respond more naturally and follow the laws of physics. You definitely should not be touching them, but if youâ€™re feeling rebellious they should now be easier to use.\n\n- Books and other held objects are oriented correctly when held or opened. Should you choose to hold them or open them... which you were politely asked not to.\n\n- Binders should not be touched. But if you pick one up, no other binders will launch discontentedly for not being The Chosen One.\n\n- The stamp now shows a green return position outline... should you want to make it seem like you in fact, did not touch it.\n\n- In an attempt to rid the room of haunted spirits, audio is now spatialized around the correct position (your head).\n\n- The credits have been updated because inclusion is nice ðŸ˜€"
