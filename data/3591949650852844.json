Now you can build anything you want through mod.io and Unreal Engine! Full guide here: https://mod.io/g/zero-caliber/r + on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/xrealgames Worry not, you can also sit back (or stand up), and enjoy the creations of other community members through the ingame mod browser. Look for the 'Special Operations' panel in the lobby!\nWe can't wait to see all the crazy maps and missions you'll come up with! In the meantime, you can enjoy a few genre-defining classics in the mod browser already. ;)\n\n## CROSS-PLAY PVP\n\nNow that the PCVR folks are also getting the PvP game modes and maps you're all familiar with, we're enabling cross-play so you can teach them the ropes! We also took extreme care to build platform-agnostic maps to avoid unbalanced matches between standalone and PCVR players. Disclaimer: cross-play is enabled for PvP only in the base game, but modded Co-op maps could be cross-play if the creator chooses to build them so.\n\n## QOL IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXES\n\nWe've honestly lost count of how many fixes and improvements we squeezed into this update, but here are the ones worth mentioning:\n\n# AI\n\n- Improved AI behaviour and pathfinding\n- Improved combat behaviour on several maps\n- Fixed and rearranged enemy spawn locations on several maps\n- Fixed a rendering issue that affected enemy visuals\n\n# GAMEPLAY | CONTROLS\n\n- Fixed PvP loadout issues\n- Fixed a checkpoint issue that could cause players getting stuck in the tutorial's cave part\n- Improved collision settings on countless objects and environment elements\n- Fixed a sneaky collision bug in PvP (that we hope you haven't noticed)\n- Fixed an issue with shotgun shells\n- Sock 18 and M249 rebalance\n- BAR handling improvements\n- Fixed a sync and infinite-ammo issue for affected weapons\n- Improved playzone settings on PvP maps to prevent players getting below ground level\n- Fixed a few POI related issues\n- Improved controls all around\n- Fixed melee holster position\n- Improved voice-chat stability and fixed a few connection issues\n- Improved friend invite and friend request systems\n\n# VISUALS | PERFORMANCE\n\n- Overhauled lighting on several maps\n- Improved color balance and contrast ratios throughout the game\n- Improved foliage all around\n- Fixed several LOD related issues\n- Fixed countless assets popping out of thin air\n- Fixed shadows for several weapons\n- Improved weapon models (forgot which ones, whoops. But they look prettier now!)\n- Improved UI\n- Fixed quite a few hand poses on smaller items\n- Improved loading times between missions/multiplayer sessions\n- Optimized several maps for smoother gameplay\n\n# SERVERS\n\n- Added a brand new dedicated Aussie server for those down under\n- Improved server stability\n- Enabled cross-play between standalone and PCVR versions (PvP and mod only)\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES \n\nWe still have a potential progress loss issue when the Quest runs out of juice during gameplay. It's a relatively wide-spread problem affecting numerous games, and will supposedly be fixed in the v56 OS version. If that doesn't happen, we have a workaround ready to be deployed - in the meantime, don't let your Quest's battery die on you! "

                "change_log": "Version 1.4.493 changelog:\n\nThe 6th update is here with the brand new Survival Game Mode, two new maps and the long-awaited M249 light machine gun!\nWe've also added stats to every mission's briefing screen in the lobby - you can now keep track of your personal records.\n\n# NEW GAME MODE AND MAPS\n\nThe new Survival game mode revolves around the ‚ÄòDefense‚Äô theme.\nRepel the attacks and survive until extraction, or‚Ä¶ stay, and give ‚Äòem hell for as long as you can!\n\n- On ‚ÄòCritical Mass‚Äô, your task is to defend a stationary nuclear bomb while waves after waves of Tlalokii soldiers try to sabotage your mission - get your CQB skills ready!\n- On ‚ÄòThe VIP‚Äô, your objective is to defend a very important person: Bob. He‚Äôll fight with you, but remember: keeping him (and yourself) alive is key - make sure to check every door and window, Tlalokii soldiers are everywhere!\n\nIMPORTANT: bringing your own loadout to these locations is not possible - you‚Äôll start with a single pistol instead. Don‚Äôt worry though, you‚Äôll receive a well-deserved supply crate containing more effective, more badass weapons and attachments after each wave. Make sure to collect them before the next wave starts!\n\nATTENTION: this game mode is hard. While there is no rank requirement to unlock it, we recommend reaching at least Rank 30 before jumping in. Or...\nGrab your friends (or strangers) and help each other in Co-op, we guarantee it‚Äôs gonna be a blast!\n\n# WEAPONS, ATTACHMENTS AND SKINS\n\nThe M249 is finally making an appearance - this deservedly famous light machine gun really packs a punch!\nIt unlocks at Rank 20 (or after getting it from a supply crate in the new Survival Mode) and can be found in the ‚Äòassault rifle‚Äô category.\nTo celebrate the new game mode, we added two new weapon skins - one for the Famas, and one for the Mx4 Storm. Both skins can be unlocked in the new Survival Mode.\n\nIn addition, the SG552 also received a new skin, and we added a new attachment as well: the HAMR Scope.\n\n# FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\nBesides the new content, we fixed countless minor graphics- and gameplay related bugs, improved server stability and tweaked the overall difficulty of the game.\nWe also improved the end screen you see at the end of each mission. Here's the full list:\n\n- Redesigned mission end screen UI\n- Added mission objective UI\n- Co-op synchronisation fixes (tanky AI, hit detection, late join related issues)\n- Improved AI animations (including cover animations)\n- Improved AI cover usage\n- Improved AI pathfinding and movement\n- Improved Co-op user interface: level info/status sync\n- M14: improved iron sight\n- MAC-11: improved two-handed accuracy\n- KRISS Vector: decreased horizontal recoil and decreased recoil while the drum mag is equipped\n- MP5 and MP5SD: improved two-handed accuracy and decreased horizontal recoil\n- P90: improved two-handed accuracy and decreased horizontal recoil\n- UMP45: decreased one-handed accuracy and horizontal recoil\n- Glock 18c: increased one-handed and two-handed accuracy\n- Increased draw distance for weapons and attachments (Quest 2 only)\n- Improved sky in the shooting part of the Tutorial\n- Improved sniper reload\n- Various weapon skin improvements\n- Asset resolution improvements\n- Fixed several cover colliders\n- Improved weapon LOD\n- Countless minor graphics and gameplay fixes\n\n# NEXT UPDATE\n\nBy the time you read this we have already started working on the next update - it'll bring yet another brand new Survival map as well as improvements for the current ones.\nKeep an eye on our socials to see when that's coming!\n\n# CONTACT US\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us at support@xrealgames.com\nMore updates are on the way so stay tuned, and have fun!\n"
