        "description": "Play the beats you usually study/relax to! 📚\nLOFI Katana is a VR rhythm game with a unique atmosphere inspired by everyone’s favourite late-night playlists.\nLeave your room and head to the highest rooftop. Find your musical sanctuary away from the city noise. Hit the shurikens with your katana and wave your fan to the rhythm of the music.\n\nDon’t stop the music!\nExperience the atmosphere around you reacting to your actions and immerse yourself in the flow of your favourite tracks. To integrate your music, you will simply need to put your MP3 or WAV files into the game's /Music folder. Our Algorithm itself will take care of creating a deterministic gameplay from the song and generating a level from the parameters you have chosen.\n\nGameplay\n-Enjoy your music with simple but challenging sequences that blend dance and combat:\n-In Classic mode, flip your fan to match the incoming ones, and wield a katana in your other hand to slice the flying shurikens coming towards you.\n-Select your difficulty level, from a calm and relaxing routine to a more challenging and energetic session.\n-Try out the alternative modes: “Only Fans” and “Only Katanas” for a new take on the Classic gameplay.\n-LIV integration available for streamers and influencers who like to dance and move along with their favourite music!\n\nStep into LOFI Katana Discord community -> https://discord.gg/NgfBpNxCQy\n\nMusic in Trailer: Forest Shrine by Kerusu",
