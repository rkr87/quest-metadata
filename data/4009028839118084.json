        "description": "AVATOUR makes real-time remote presence possible for the first time. Using an inexpensive 360Â° camera and a standard mobile device, an AVATOUR host can invite up to 9 remote guests to a live experience of a real place. Guests may join using this Oculus app, or on desktop or mobile using any web browser. Unlike a standard live stream, an AVATOUR is real time, allowing guests to communicate with each other and with the host user in the real world.\n\nAVATOUR is an innovative new way to talk with people about a space - without having to bring them there in person. It has applications for architecture, retail, property management, real estate, construction, tourism, and much more.\n\nVisit avatour.co for more information, or to register for an AVATOUR Host account.",
