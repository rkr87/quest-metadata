        "description": "This Umpire training helps you work on calls at home plate and at first base. More situations are in the roadmap. The training is available for baseball, fastpitch softball and slowpitch softball.\nAt home plate you can select the pitch speed (or height for slowpitch), the location, variations, spin and wind. And you can select if you want feedback directly during the pitch or afterwards.\nAt first base you can practice close calls or work in a game-like context where the system determines the timing. After the call you can replay the action to see if you made the right call.",
