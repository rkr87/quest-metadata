        "description": "** SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED (US $23.99/year)**\n\nPrisms launched to schools around the US in 2021 to bring problem-driven, tactile, and visual learning to the Math classroom. Our teachers and students were the first to learn math in a whole new way, and now anyone in the world can too! In Prisms, users gain math skills through:\n\n- Experiencing and solving important real-world problems\n- Using hands-on models to visualize and interact with structure\n- Connecting 3D experiences to abstract representations like graphs, tables (2D), and equations / vocabulary (1D)\n\nPrisms has 3 key components:\n\n- VR content modules for students to deepen their understanding of core concepts\n- A multiplayer sandbox for additional practice problems\n- Teaching materials to support efficacious learning. Contact us at partnerships@prismsvr.com to gain access to these resources. A web-based dashboard is also available for our school district partners.\n\nTopics:\n\nMiddle School- Fractions; Ratios; Rate of Change; Probability; Surface Area\n\nAlgebra I- Linear Functions; Systems of Equations; Quadratics; Linear Regression; Exponential Functions\n\nGeometry- Transformations; Distance Formula; Trig Ratios; Circles; Solids of Rotation\n\nAdvanced Algebra- Periodic Functions; Complex Numbers; Polar Coordinates; Vector Addition; Ellipses; Matrices\n\nAfter completing modules, you can jump into our multiplayer sandbox for practice.
