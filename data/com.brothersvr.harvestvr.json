Previously each object would have 1 color. But this has been changed so that now little gradients are found on each and every object. Also this helps us a LOT for performance since we only have a single pallette to colour everything!\n\nModular Mine!\nThe mine has been rebuild from the ground up and is now different every time you enter!\n\nFishing 2.0\nYou can now fish for some new fish using fishing lures! Those lures will have you catch 4 new kinds of fish + we've added the ability to catch boots!\n\nRecipes 2.0\nRecipes has been completely revamped! Each recipe now has it's own separate view + an overview page to scroll through the recipes + since we have some new fish we\n\nBeehives\nAdded beehives! You can buy them from the animal store. They give you lots of honey!\n\nNew Plants\nOfcourse what is a new Harvest VR update without any new Harvest! Here are some new plants.\n\nBlueberry\nRaspberry\nSaguaro Cactus\nOpuntia Cactus\nNew Quests\nSimplified questing mechanics for us to create cool quests for you! We've added 4 new quests for you to complete.\n\nCleanup Crew\nShell Finder\nArchery minigame\nWe added a fun little minigame for archers. Now you dont have to wait for hunting to actually use the bow!\n\nSkin color changing\nYou can now change the color of your skin! We added few basic colors but let us know if you like some more!\n\nOther cool changes\nAdded some grass to the farmable lands if no plants are planted.\nRedesign of flowers\nFlowers are now animated\nAdded nightlights to the beach.\nAdded a mirror as buyable item for you house.\nAdded 3 kinds of clams to the beach.\nAdded 7 new pixel art to the art store.\nAdded new pixelated icons to the world map.\nAdded an indicator to \"plant of the week\" to see how long you still have.\nNew models for the ores.\nMade milk buckets stackable.\nBalanced coconut selling price.\nChanged text for plants growing to \"days left\"\nIncreased default deadzone\nAdded a \"are you sure?\" dialog for people deleting their animals.\nUnder the hood\nThis might be less interesting for you! But we've completely redone most of Harvest VR's core mechanics. We've redone, NPC's dialoging, item/store/fishing/plants organising, added testing, added test coverage, and a LOT(and I mean really, a LOT) more. This results in making the game more stable, more easy to continue building on, AND more fun for us to work on!\n\nBug Fixes\nFixed the loud background tutorial music.\nFixed a bug where you could duplicate the backpacks by snapping it to the basket.\nFixed a bug where the vending machine would give the item below the one selected.\nFixed a bug where multiple saves would overlamp.\nFixed a bug where modern lamp would be saved as default lamp\nFixed vending machine lever near the fishing pond wouldn't move.\nFixed a bug where red mushrooms let you fly.\nFixed a bug where NPC dialog would sometimes not appear.\nQuests where remove on new game.

(only in same lvl, it is NOT a place to stash stuff).\nIgnore player colliders near face to stop screenfading\nScroll sensitivity on vending machine\nScroll scrollbar color on vending machine\nFixed plants + oven buttons showing when kitchen is not bought."

But we've completely redone most of Harvest VR's core mechanics. We've redone, NPC's dialoging, item/store/fishing/plants organising, added testing, added test coverage, and a LOT(and I mean really, a LOT) more. This results in making the game more stable, more easy to continue building on, AND more fun for us to work on!\n\nBug Fixes\nFixed the loud background tutorial music.\nFixed a bug where you could duplicate the backpacks by snapping it to the basket.\nFixed a bug where the vending machine would give the item below the one selected.\nFixed a bug where multiple saves would overlamp.\nFixed a bug where modern lamp would be saved as default lamp\nFixed vending machine lever near the fishing pond wouldn't move.\nFixed a bug where red mushrooms let you fly.\nFixed a bug where NPC dialog would sometimes not appear.\nQuests where remove on new game.
