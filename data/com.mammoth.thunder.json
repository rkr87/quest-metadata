        "description": "Thunder is an unprecedented intersection of immersive experience, indigenous stories, and language learning and preservation. Designed as a Blackfoot language learning tool, Thunder VR is adapted from the Thunder Blackfoot graphic novel. The story chronicles the journey of a man who lost his wife and must travel a great distance to challenge the powerful spirit, Thunder Ksiistsikom to get her back. On the way he encounters Elders, animals of the land, and Raven who all provide him with the gifts and wisdom he will need to confront Thunder.\n\nEach challenge requires the player to learn Blackfoot power words in order to continue forward, bringing them closer and closer to their final confrontation with the great Thunder spirit. But not everything is as it seems. In addition to learning a new set of Blackfoot words, the player will discover the truth of Thunder Ksiistsikom.",
