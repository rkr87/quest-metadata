        "description": "Museum of Plastic 2121 is the first museum tour available on Curatours!\n\nBuilt 100 years from now in an imagined future where things have worked out well for both the planet and humanity. Visitors can uncover the story of plastic - its history, science, industry, and impact on our environment. They will learn the importance of establishing a circular economy and find out how activism and individual action happening now will lead to positive change in the future. \n\nEvery Thursday in November 2021 we will be opening a new wing of the Museum of Plastic. \n\nCuratours is a social virtual tour platform for culture and heritage. Visit incredible places filled with art, artefacts, stories and friends. Visitors can access tours of museums around the world from desktop, phones or VR headsets. In VR it's an incredibly immersive experience and on other devices it feels like a cross between a video call and playing a multiplayer game.",
