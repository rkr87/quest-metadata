        "description": "As you walk through the dark corridors you get a feeling that this might not have been such a good idea, but there is no turning back now. You need to figure out a way to get access to the computers, your friend is convinced they house the surveillance videos of the murder. But will that be enough? Your intuition tells you that there must also be evidence items somewhere in the police station that the police has overlooked.\n\n\"It's a wonderfully elegant idea, and in practice it works really well.\" - Pocket Gamer\n\n“Immediately atmospheric” & “innovative locomotion system drew universal praise” – The Virtual Report\n\n“definitely adds a unique twist to A Most Curious Murder and elevates the realism.” – VRTheGamers\n\nA fully interactive game were you puzzle together evidence about what has happened and gradually unfold the story leading up to the murder.\n\nThe game is best played standing as you move around in the police station by walking on the spot. \n\nNow also supports Oculus Go.",
