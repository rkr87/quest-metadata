        "description": "Looking for a way to rock out without waking the neighbors? Look no further than Air Drums! This free game drops you into a cool 70s garage in space, with drumsticks attached to your hands and no instructions to hold you back. \n\nWhile the hand tracking may not be perfect for drumming to songs, it's still incredibly fun to smash around and play with for short bursts of time. Plus, our high-quality environment and physics-based drums will make you feel like you're actually in a real garage band.\n\nTo use the hi hat and kick drum, simply open your hand and trigger the gesture in each hand. And for the ultimate in realism, you can even hold actual drumsticks while you play!",
