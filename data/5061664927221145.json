        "description": "First Update in 2024: a new level: the big wreck of the WW2 German battlecruiser Scharnhorst! Another new quest type: free entangled turtles. Now all levels with 3 replayability levels. More fish to discover. And a tutorial level to max out what your ROV can do. 'Maximal Comfort' setting against Nausea improved. \n\nAdopt dolphins and whales and support the Whale and Dolphin Conservation WDC directly.\n\nIn the game you explore in a high-tech ROV submarine the earthâ€™s oceans from the best diving spots in the famous Galapagos or the diving paradise island Cozumel in Mexico to the icebergs in the Arctic and the Deep Sea and many other fascinating places around our planet's huge underwater world. In each of the levels you solve quests with your ROV's upgradeable tools. The missions are based around real sunken submarines, WW2 battleship wrecks, Deep Sea creatures or Caribbean coral reefs. You will also encounter all of the giants and living wonders of the oceans from sharks, to dolphins, sea turtles and of course the blue whale and discover more about this unique, beautiful and threatened world. With your mission success you take action and contribute to protect and save the oceans. And also in reality you support our partner NGOs when you adopt a dolphin or whale in-game. The game engages you to explore the oceans and allows you to go where no one has gone before to reveal the last mysteries of the oceans.",
