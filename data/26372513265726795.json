Become the valiant helicopter gunner aboard the Stingray, their deadly and cutting-edge gunship helicopter.\n\nHigh-Octane Combat: Experience non-stop action as you unleash a hail of bullets from the helicopter's door gun, mowing down hordes of enemies below. Navigate through immersive levels filled with thrilling story-driven moments.\n\nDefend Your Squad: Take on the role of the squad's aerial guardian, providing critical air support as your comrades fight on the ground. Protect them from above and secure victory for the resistance.\n\nRealism Redefined: Immerse yourself in a realistic world where enemies react dynamically to your onslaught.
