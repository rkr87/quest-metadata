        "description": "From the creators of **Job Simulator** comes an all new omniversal hand tracked cooperative multiplayer game: **Dimensional Double Shift!**\n\nAssemble a team of up to 4 friends to run the Gas N’ Grill, an omnidimensional diner and garage. Work your hardest to please your “helpful” AI manager ALICE, or ignore her — she’s only a hologram. Fix, refuel, shred, smash, and torch as you help the citizens of the omniverse. The balance of floating roadside convenience rests in you and your friends’ hands!\n\n* **Co-Working Chaos**: Crack some eggs, weld some pipes and grab your friends or frenemies to clock in for a Gas N’ Grill double shift.\n* **Multi-dimensional Mayhem:** Travel across the omniverse to different dimensions and serve their inhabitants. The real on-the-job training begins now!\n* **Spacetime Busting Humor**: Conglomni Corp. believes in a better tomorrow, from its lowliest workers to its most genius executives. Laugh through the tears of endless shift work with cheeky and provocative humor.\n* **Rewards fit for the Corporate Treadmill:** Is there a wage? Of course! If by wage you mean corporate branded swag. Earn Conglomni rewards, the most fulfilling form of “payment” since team pizza parties.\n* **Meet ALICE**: Conglomni Corp’s AI supervisor has been trained on the best data, and is ready to string together a series of words to keep you motivated! Corporate’s subcontracted outsourced programmers have moved beyond the GPT to the next generation GPC (Generally Probably Coherent). Don’t forget — she’s the boss!",
