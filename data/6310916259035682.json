        "description": "The pneumatic handheld tools VR simulation focuses on three commonly used tools for construction, manufacturing, and professional contractors. Participants explore the parts and features of the pneumatic nail gun, drill, and shears. They then apply what they have learned in hands-on activities, nailing, drilling, and cutting various materials. Participants also learn about air compressors, hoses, and fittings that power pneumatic tools. Special attention is also placed on safety tips and common injuries to reinforce awareness and reduce personal injury. \n\nBackground Primer & Activities: \nAn overview provides context and helps identify the various tools, related parts, safety concerns, and common injuries. Then, participants engage in a sort-and-match activity to test what they learned. Embedded learning outcomes based on Bloom’s revised taxonomy include remembering, understanding, and applying. \n\nParticipant Simulation: \nThe interactive and manipulative simulation allows participants to explore, learn, and practice operating each pneumatic tool in a safe and realistic format. Before they begin, participants must don personal protective equipment (PPE) and then move to individual stations to work with a specific tool. \n\nBenefits & Key Features:\n • Manipulative Simulation: Hands-on practice in a risk-free environment.\n • Transferable skills can be directly applied to real-world scenarios.\n • Realistic 3D tools, equipment, and environments.",
