        "description": "\"Astral Guardian: The Quest of Lyria\" invites players into a vibrant, cartoonish universe where dimensions are at risk and memories hang in the balance. Under the dark shadow of Mordrax, the tyrant who has enslaved the universe, players join Lyria, the last Dimensional Nomad, on a quest to recover Memory Fragments from various dimensions. Each fragment not only holds the power to challenge Mordrax but also preserves the memories, histories, and very souls of every dimension's inhabitants.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is its innovative mixed-reality gameplay. While guiding Lyria using the joystick, players can also interact directly with the environment. Grab, shift, and manipulate objects to solve intricate puzzles and help Lyria succeed. This unique blend offers a fresh and immersive experience, making the game stand out on the Oculus platform.\n\nDesigned with families and kids in mind, the game delivers fun, challenge, and creativity in equal measure. Although currently featuring one world with four engaging levels, \"Astral Guardian\" is ever-expanding, with more worlds and adventures on the horizon. And for those competitive spirits, the integrated high-score board adds a layer of replay value. Battle for the top spot, see how your performance stacks up against others, and immerse yourself in this captivating MR adventure!",
