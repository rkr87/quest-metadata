        "description": "Georgian winemaking method is a part of UNESCO Intangible Heritage. It is the longest uninterrupted tradition of creating wine in the world. Georgia is also one of the oldest winegrowing countries - the pips of the grapes that have been found at Shulaveri Gora historical site are witnessing the fact that the locals were cultivating vines here around 8000 years ago.\nHow does a winery visit look like, once you're in Georgia? Of course, it's a bit of history, a bit of technology, and of course, some excellent food, drinks, songs, and toasts. Take a tour in Giuaani Winery in Manavi (Kakheti), discover more about the Georgian wine, and attend the friendly Georgian supra with the international visitors afterward!\nOf course, this is a demo version that gives you an idea about a half a day winery tour - it takes only one hour to get there from Tbilisi. But a deeper immersion will take you a bit longer. More wineries, more tastings, more exciting landscapes... Georgia is very diverse!",
