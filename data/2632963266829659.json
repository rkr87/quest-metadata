An incredible journey through colorful retro worlds and ridiculous alien invaders. \n\n● A room-scale BULLET HELL shooter experience, inspired by 1980s arcade RETRO classics.\n● With your spare hand, snatch a POWER-UP out of the air to get the jump on your enemies. A CHAINSAW? A YO-YO? Is that a SHARK ON A FREAKIN’ STICK?\n● Want to just chill in your armchair? That’s OK! Switch to CHILL difficulty and take it easy, couch potato.\n● Want an extra challenge? Just switch the game difficulty to OVERDRIVE! (Nice knowing you BTW)\n● But you’re not done yet... Go back and fly challenging side missions to unlock an entire SQUADRON of diverse pilots.\n● Shooty Skies Overdrive is cross-buy enabled for Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest.",
