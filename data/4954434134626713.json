As you may have noticed we're going through a sequence of big updates recently whilst going through a lot of community feedback.\nThis update is mostly focused around the overall visual quality of the game, as well as a few improvements and changes to gameplay. Enjoy!\n\nGraphics:\n- Improved all water quality\n- Improved surrounding scenery, it also changes as you progress through the ranks\n- Slightly updated the puzzle grid to be more visually appealing\n- New pipe model/textures so they feel more lively!\n- Redesigned clouds plain\n- New water end point, so it's clearer and more interesting where the water needs to go. They are color coded AND have text that says what they are for (\"Water Collection\" on blue, Waste Collection\" on yellow).\n\nGameplay:\n- CHALLENGE BADGES added to each level. Complete each task to earn 3 badges per level.\n\nMenu:\n- Update Menu UI for end of levels. Now you'll see the badges you've earned with your level stats. And will be able to start the next level (if unlocked) immediately, play the current level again or return to the main menu.\n- Menu follows your head less aggressively now, so you can look around a fair amount and if you look too far away from the menu only then will it return to your view.\n- Updated Clipboard graphics, UI is more rounded and smooth.\n\nBug Fixes:\n- Fixed bug where if you dropped a block, it would return to the dispender and get...blocked?\n- Fixed issue where music would'nt loop in some instances."

Here's a fairly big update with a lot of quality of life improvements: \n\n- Puzzle grid can now be rotated horizontally. Playing seated is much easier now!\n- Pipes can now be put back into the dispensers.\n- Pipes will return to the dispensers if dropped!\n- Xmas themed props have been removed (somehow they kept coming back, like a neverending Xmas).\n- Text overhaul! No more pixelation, so text is always crisp and much easier to read now.\n- Any held pipes will be destroyed at the end of a level (no more carrying pipes over between levels, though that made for a good hack I admit)"
