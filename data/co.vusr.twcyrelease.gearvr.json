        "description": "The seasonality of the weather on our planet defines and drives the lives of every creature on earth. Humans, plants and wildlife must navigate the changing conditions they face as a result of our planet’s annual trip around the sun. But in some places the effects of the seasons are especially pronounced - one of those places is Canada. Lightning storms and tornados whipping across the Canadian prairies, secret worlds buried beneath the snow, polar bears hunting in the open summer waters of Hudson Bay, a bizarre animal that lives underground and has 28 tentacles around its mouth instead of eyes, frogs that actually freeze solid in the winter - miraculously coming back to life year after year each spring, and lynx that walk on snow chasing their elusive quarry through the northern forests – THE WILD CANADIAN YEAR will showcase the most amazing and rare natural wonders of Canada.",
