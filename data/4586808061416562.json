We know that the vast majority of users do not have a spare Bluetooth keyboard to pair with their headset. Even those who do occasionally forget to bring the it. That’s why we’ve built the Softspace Network Keyboard: a web app that lets you use a laptop, desktop, or even iPad as a physical keyboard for text input in Softspace.\n- The buttons for deleting and copying TopicItems are now easier to select and switch between without accidentally selecting UI elements behind them, because the gap between them has been closed.\n- Workspaces are now associated with a specific logged-in user. Signing out of a Softspace account will remove access to those workspaces until that account is signed in again. Note: Workspaces are still only stored locally. Workspaces are not synced across devices, and deleting the Softspace app from your headset will delete all workspace data.\n- More robust handling of and support for browser popup windows.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Settings and account management UI is prevented from appearing too far below eye-level.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Speech-to-text button occasionally stops working, requiring an app restart.\n- Virtual keyboard audio feedback occasionally stops working, requiring an app restart.\n- AI-features sometimes take a long time to load—we’re looking into faster APIs.\n- Workspaces with large numbers of content items can cause low framerates.\n- Browsing websites with heavy scripts or 3D rendering can cause frame drops."

The highlights are: multiple web browsers, much faster image loading, and more comfortable UI for improved core usability.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- New, one-click UI for creating Topics, web browsers, and AI queries.\n- Browser instances are now independent Items in the workspace, Therefore, multiple browsers are possible, but only one is “active” at a time to maintain smooth framerates.\n- New image processing library is 10-100x faster than previous implementation.\n- Added safeguards against accidental gripping and clicking by hands outside field-of-view.\n- Re-introduced positional snapping and overlap prevention for anchored Items in workspace.\n- Removed automatic Item scaling (previously introduced) to prevent visual overlap of Items.\n- Added an indicator UI at the bottom of the field-of-view that shows date and time, network status, and keyboard status.\n- Added a “copy” button to Topics that copies contents as Markdown to the clipboard.\n- Changed the font of Text items to be more writing-friendly.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Speech-to-text button occasionally stops working, requiring an app restart.\n- Virtual keyboard audio feedback occasionally stops working, requiring an app restart.\n- AI-features sometimes take a long time to load—we’re looking into faster APIs.\n- Workspaces with large numbers of content items can cause low framerates.\n- Browsing websites with heavy scripts or 3D rendering can cause frame drops."
