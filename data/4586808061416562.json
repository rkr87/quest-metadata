Quest 2 and Pro: limit = 1. Quest 3: limit = 3;\n- Reduced browser scrolling frequency from 72 times to 36 times per second for smoother browser performance with minimal visible impact.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- The Dropbox authentication can expire, preventing the Dropbox import and export features from working. If this happens, please unlink Dropbox from the Account settings pages and relink.\n- Speech-to-text button occasionally stops working, requiring an app restart.\n- Workspaces with large numbers of content items can cause low framerates.\n- Browsing websites with heavy scripts or 3D rendering can cause frame drops."
