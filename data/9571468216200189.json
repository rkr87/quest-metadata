        "description": "Eat your friends in 'SHARKS' a cross-platform (PC and VR) multiplayer hunting game. Hunt with groups of up to 10 people online. Eat whatever you can to survive and avoid the zombie sharks: last player standing wins.\n\nThe VR controls are super responsive (it feels like a human-shark mind meld): simply look where you want the shark to swim. Pull the trigger to move forward, press the grip button to chomp/eat things. \n\nYou can also play with your non-VR friends on the flat-screen version. Each game is a quick snack-sized round so it's perfect to just drop-in or -out whenever you've got a spare minute.\n\nCollect goldfish to customise your shark with tons of unlockable hats, eyes, teeth and extras. Who would have thought sharks could be so cute?\n\nThere's no pay-to-win so everyone is on equal terms....and if you get tired of eating each other, there are plenty of other things to chomp on (more game modes coming soon)\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get your friends to download SHARKS and start eating each other today!\n\nNote: This is a demo version with one game mode (zombie tag) and one arena. If you like what you see so far please leave a review and include any suggestions so we can make sure your ideas make it into to the final full game. Thanks!",
