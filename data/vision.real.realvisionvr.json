        "description": "Realvision VR lets you experience the future of real estate by exploring thousands of properties shot by professional real estate photographers from around the world. \nThanks to their keen eye for quality, the professional photographers who have adopted Realvision have helped real estate professionals connect more sellers with more buyers by offering a listing experience like no other.\n“Since adopting Realvision, we’ve seen an increase in number of listings taken, and a decrease in days on market and number of showings to sell a property.” -Brandon Doyle, 2017 Inman Real Estate Influencer and co-author of “Mindset, Methods & Metrics: Winning as a Modern Real Estate Agent”\n“We’ve had nearly 100 of our properties captured with Realvision. The interactive walkthrough continues to be the de facto standard to which all virtual tours are measured up against.” -Ravi Singh, Connexus Group\n“It’s the showing of the future.” -Bethany Nelson, Experience Minnesota Home Team",
