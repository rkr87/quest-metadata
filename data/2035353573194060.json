        "description": "Half + Half is a multiplayer game about fun & connection. The game includes five unique multiplayer spaces that are designed to help you connect with people you know, and also to connect with people you donâ€™t, even if only for a short while.\n\nSwim in the ocean. Glide through clouds. Play human tetris with friends, or Hide & Seek where hiders are two inches tall, and seekers are as tall as buildings.\n\nEvery space in Half + Half is designed to be fun, but also to make you look as ridiculous as possible in real life. Half + Half is made to be fun for you, but also fun for everyone in the same room.",
