        "description": "Juzzle is a modern take on the classic Japanese 2D puzzle Sokoban.  Juzzle may look easy at first glance, but only a select few will be able to finish the game. These friendly faced jellies will have you scratching your head in no time! Work your brain out with 20 levels of adorable frustration!\n\nIn each level there are a number of blue jelly friends. Your goal as the green jelly is to push your friends to the blue targets. The order does not matter, but sometimes it takes a little creativity to figure out the solution.  Get your Juzzle on!\n",
